Banana / Clove like esters abd phenols coming through, although a lot of hops was used (in the wrong way) this is not a hop forward beer at all, in fact I would say less than 10 IBU. finish dry/sweet with a lingering crisp hop and malt. Note for next brew, no hop balls!!! and More late ferment hop additions. Same Yeast possibly sour the beer.....",[]

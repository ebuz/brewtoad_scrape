20140,5244,Session  Dee,"November 27, 2014  3:07pm","This is a refreshing, somewhat zesty beer, with a bit of a sweet/sour tamarind twang at the end. I thought it would make a great late summer/early fall refresher, which it was. I liked it; but didn't necessary love it. Here's what worked well: step mashed: raised the temp slowly from 131 (15 min), held it at 147 for 45 min to get those wonderful sugars, then held it at 156 for about 25 min for those dextrinous sugars. It was a great wort, and I was happy with the 1.052 OG. I like the minimal hops profile, and to be honest, I may suggest dropping the late hop addition. The peppery yeast quality has a nice interplay with the tamarind flavors. This brings me to what I'd do different next time: I thought it would be important to balance the tamarind flavor with a bit of a malt backbone. I still think this, but I don't think you'd need the sweet crystal and specialty malts ( Special B, Crystal 120) -- it just muddles up the featured tamarind flavor. Maybe keep the aromatic, or substitute Victory, or just 20 or 40 crystal and leave be. That would also give you a nice color. The wheat and oats additions were more about keeping with the farmhouse profile, lending a nice head and subtle mouth feel. I'd keep it, as well as the late coriander and grains of paradise additions, though those are truly optional. btw, the better Belgian-inspired ales I've done all had a bit of sugar either at the end of the boil or on the 2nd day of fermentation. It helps to dry it out nicely. Oh, and one last thing: if you use this yeast (which I love; one of my faves along with WLP550), be sure to ramp it up to 90 to 95 degrees. Trust me, it loves high temps, and it won't fully attenuate without it. Ultimately, as with any saison, the key is restraint, fresh yeast, and solid fermentation temp control. 
I recommend a 7-10 day primary, then a 2-3 week secondary for conditioning. Tasty, a bit sweet/tart and refreshing at 1.5 months from brew date.
Okay, sorry if that's way too much info. It's a good beer; feel free to shoot me any further questions. Good luck, and happy brewing.",[]

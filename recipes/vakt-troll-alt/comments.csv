It's very agressive at warm temperatures and I've even noticed some interesting clove flavors when you take it into the mid 70's range.  One change I would make to this recipe next time is to change the Hops around, 1 oz at 50 min and 2 oz at 5 to bring the bitterness more in check with Biere de Garde style.",['22296']

I brewed a Flanders Red a few weeks ago that I am souring for the next year, when transferring the unsoured beer to the oak barrel i sampled and decided it was really an ideal recipe for a Biere de Garde and then the Vakt Troll emerged as a variant from the Flanders, especially with 072. :)",[]

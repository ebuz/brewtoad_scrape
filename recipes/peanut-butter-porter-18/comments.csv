19894,22525,Derek Gillespie,"November 05, 2014  5:27pm",I've used PB2 before in a stout but the malt bill was too roasty and dark to do the peanut butter justice.  There is also a PB2 with chocolate and a friend has used that to make a PB Porter too.  My concern is the PB2 in secondary (which I haven't done yet) - will the yeast eat it?  Should I cold crash?,[]

I just mixed the peanut butter powder with vodka for my secondary and find that the powder to liquid ratio makes for a very powdery mix. Did you have this problem? What did you do? Or how did you add the peanut powder to your recipe?",['20777']
20777,22525,Derek Gillespie,"February 02, 2015  4:05pm","I added the PB2 to the boil only the first couple times I made it.  A friend who made the recipe said he used PB2 in the boil and in the secondary (mix it with hot, sterile water).",[]

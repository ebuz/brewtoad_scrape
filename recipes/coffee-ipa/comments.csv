1st, how did this turn out? sounds like a wonderfully refreshing brew! after years of brewing, i am still trying to nail down the best way to utilize coffee in beer. was it coffee-y enough?
thanks!",['18042']

Coffee was very present, but it worked i think because of the earthy hops that was chosen.  Head retention was not good because of the choice to use the beans (oils etc). It came back over time.  I might try a toddy next time.  This recipe was loved by everyone. 
My wife actually roasted the coffee, so I did a coffee cupping with 4 different roasts to find one that I thought worked.  I wanted something simple and not too bitter.  I will definitely be brewing this again.",[]

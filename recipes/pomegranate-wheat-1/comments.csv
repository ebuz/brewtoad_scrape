23855,29467,Brumanchu,"June 13, 2016  8:21pm","I turned out really well, nice and dry....from memory it was 1.008 I believe.  In addition to the flavor of the fruit, the pomegranate added a nice tartness to the finish.  It was pinkish color in the fermenter but much of that color fell out in the bottle so it was very lightly colored from the pomegranate.  I've found that added naturally flavored green teas really adds to the aroma of the beer more than the flavor.  It's a nice addition.  If you make the beer let me know how you like it.  Cheers!",[]

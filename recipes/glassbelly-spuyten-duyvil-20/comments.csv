The Saaz also all turned out  to be pretty low alpha (3%), so it's going to be a little sweet, as well. (Although Brewtoad predicts 1.019 FG, which is not going to happen -- we'll get it down to 1.012 - 1.014, at least, so it'll be a little drier and pack a little more punch than the projected 7.9% ABV.)",[]

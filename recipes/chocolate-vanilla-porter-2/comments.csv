19067,56689,Jim Schaefer,"August 06, 2014  5:32am","Great , thanks a bunch !  This will be another great  Beer to add to my mash list  : )  I`m getting prepared for the upcoming winter , and we have looooong winters in Winnipeg . Last year broke a 135 yr record for length and temperatures. I see your in Oslo ?  How did an American  Brewer  ( with an unreal system , I might add )  come to be living  in Oslo , Norway ? lol   Are beer ingrediants easy to come by over there ? Being in Europe , most likely I would guess ?",[]

22835,63418,Robert Miettunen,"October 24, 2015  6:28pm",I have a question about the steps. Since I am quite unfamiliar with the temperatures required for fermentation I would have liked to ask at what temperature and how long did you ferment. Thanks,['22837']
22837,31492,TonyYates,"October 25, 2015  9:34am","Hi Robert,
I ferment this beer at 18C/64.4F, for 1 week, then let it rise to 20C/68F for the 2nd week. Depending on the activity, a bubble every minute or so, I'll rack to the secondary on the cocoa nibs and vanilla beans. After that, I let it sit for avg 12 days, then cold crash for 3-5 days, then keg. Hope this helps, Cheers!",[]

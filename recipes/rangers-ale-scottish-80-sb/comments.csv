20241,5341,Phillip McDaniel,"December 11, 2014  1:16pm","Transfered at 11 days in primary to a secondary to be cold crashed for 7 days before bottling.  FG measured 1.012 a couple points below target.  
Transfer Tasting Notes:
Pale amber, style appropriate, nice and bright, will be nice when cleared and carbed.  Nose is promising; carmel, treacle, and hints of grainy sweetness.  Also fairly green/rough with floral notes that are nice but will probably dissipate with time, Scottish Ale yeast esters apparent, they too should subdue with time.  Has a very nice carmel candy aroma.  Mouthfeel is thin and bitter, too much so for the style.  Smokey Scottish phenolic is apparent and very nice, grainy, hay with a hint of bitter herb.  Almost citrus brightness, burned carmel.  Should round into being quite drinkable.  Faults at this point are it's lack of sweetness and just being young, could use more carmel notes.  Fix with more carmel, at least 50% more, next time brewed.",[]

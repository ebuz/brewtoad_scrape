I just made the same recipe with just Citra hops and feel it's the best one I've made. So I figured I'd try Equinox to see what the difference is.
Thanks 
Pat.",['20598']

the equinox a try any way. I really like the Citra one I also. My fermentables are very similar to yours but I use a lot more
hops so I'll see. I get back with a comment when I finally get it make.",[]

21531,23013,cgeorge,"April 04, 2015  3:08pm",I steep them all together for about an hour around 150F.  I think alot of people only do it for 1/2 hour.,[]

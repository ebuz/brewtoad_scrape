     Any guidance on which of your de garre recipes turned out better.  I had this beer recently and am eager to clone. 
Best, Chris",['24489']
24489,28157,richardsj13,"December 20, 2016  7:10am","Yeah, this turned out fairly close to the real deal, though not as potent as the delicious DeGarre Tripel.   The Westmalle yeast works well, but needs to be kept warm.  I've also tried the Wyeast 3739 Flanders yeast on the latest batch (as it's from the same brewery as the deGarre), but it's not quite ready yet so not sure if it's as good.",[]

   I brewed your  other Degarre grain bill with the WLP 530.  Turned out well.  I mean really well.  How did your batch with the Flanders 3739 go?  
Best, Chris",[]

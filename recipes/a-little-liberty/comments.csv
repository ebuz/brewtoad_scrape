I also know I should have taken grainy's advice and only used 1/2 of it to pitch this batch on. take about a blow off. I was able to bring the temp back down to 70F with in about 12 hours of start of fermentation so I am hoping it wont have to many off flavors. on a positive note I hit 77% brew house efficiency with my mash. I ended up mashing for 120 minutes because I started the mash, then bottled the cream ale. then I had to go to the store for ice. before I knew it 2 hours had past. I think my improved efficiencies was more a product of keeping my mash temp at 152F which I have had a problem with the last 2 times. I had to pre heat the mash tun with 1 gallon of boiling water for 20 minutes then heat my strike water to 170F. by the time I started my dough in it was at 160F. still had to add 1/2 gallon @ 170F to bring it back up to 152F but once I did that it stayed there for 2 hours.",[]

Why the 100g of Munich? Will that have any discernible effect?
If you want some liquid yeast I can hook you up with WLP001 or 004.",[]

About the Munich, two reason:
1. I read that Pale Two shouldn't make up more than 75% of a grain bill. I'm not sure why this is, but I did a survey of Porter recipes and have seen that many include a ""junk"" light grain to pad the gravity
2. I have left over munich. This will actually be mostly munich with a little Pilsner mixed in.",[]

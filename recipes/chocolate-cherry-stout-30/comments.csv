20006,19699,nagorka,"November 17, 2014  1:30am","A mash temperature range of 148 to 154 °F (64 to 68 °C) works well. Use a lower mash temperature when using lower attenuating yeasts or high starting gravities and use a higher temperature when using the higher attenuating yeasts or lower starting gravity beers.
Most of the fermentations should be around the 65 to 70 °F (18 to 21 °C) range depending on the yeast strain and recipe.
If you wish, you can raise the temperature a few degrees near the end of fermentation to help the yeast clean up some of the intermediate compounds produced during fermentation, but with an appropriate pitch and proper temperature control that shouldn’t be necessary.",[]

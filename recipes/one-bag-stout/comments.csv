Might be an odd USA vs UK clash between the hops - Chinook is a pretty harsh bittering hop I find - love it in APAs but it might detract from the Fuggle. Or go US stout and use the Chinook for flavour instead of Fuggle and hit it at 0min as well! But that's just me I'm quite a stickler for style conservatism at the moment and not as adventurous and experimental as you! Malt bill looks good :),[]

I'm thinking of doing a brew with a similar grain mix but with a saison yeast.",['17069']

The honey is more of a sweetness that counteracts some of the hop bitterness, I had originally planned on adding twice as much but ran out, but am very pleased with the end result.  Pretty balanced but still has some bite.",['22875']

In my view, it doesn't add sweetness, as all the sugars are consumed by the yeast. But it does leave a very pleasant taste og flowers and summer. I would recommend around 5% of total gravity as a good starting point (normally use around 250 gr honey for around 5 kg of malt). Thanks for the recipe and gl.",[]

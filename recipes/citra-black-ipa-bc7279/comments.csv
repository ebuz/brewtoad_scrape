16699,45727,Joppo43,"December 30, 2013  6:11am",It boosts the ABV and dries out the beer. Corn sugar is 100% fermentable so it will boost the alcohol without affecting the malt profile.,['16713']
16713,7025,pfunkross,"December 31, 2013  2:12pm","Yep, basically what Joppo43 said. I'm targeting an ABV and replacing some of the malt with corn sugar to increase dryness. Dryness in an IPA helps keep the balance toward the hops.
Also, you should get slightly better hop utilization by adding the corn sugar at the end of the boil vs. at the beginning.
Cheers!",['16716']

16752,48350,thekidkelly,"January 03, 2014 12:40am",Has anyone brewed this? How did it come out? I want to do a BIPA but some recipes call for chocolate malt and just wanted some input.,['16759']
16759,7025,pfunkross,"January 03, 2014  2:24pm","It's been a while since I've brewed this one, but it scored a 43/50 in a regional BJCP comp. You can check the brew log for some reviews/tasting notes. Cheers!",[]

20259,60964,groutgauss,"December 12, 2014  7:29pm","This reminds me of Stone XI Anniversary grain bill, except with Citra instead of Chinook, Simcoe, Amarillo hop bill.  I will try this this weekend, thank pfunk",['21119']

20991,63772,PetePete,"February 22, 2015 12:53am",Just brewed this earlier today. Smells great! Unfortunately I forgot to add the irish moss. Hope that doesn't mess it up too much!,['21118']
21118,7025,pfunkross,"March 04, 2015  1:45am",No big worries on clarity in such a dark beer. Cheers!,[]
21010,63310,Michael Smihosky,"February 23, 2015  2:04pm",Brewed this the other day and ended up with Intense flavor black malt because that was all my local store had in stock... I really hope it isnt too overpowering.  Sipped the wort and it had definite coffee tones... i hope they mellow out some.,['21120']
21120,7025,pfunkross,"March 04, 2015  1:49am",I used 500L black malt in this recipe as listed and it was well received. Hopefully it works out for your taste buds too. Cheers!,['21122']
21122,63310,Michael Smihosky,"March 04, 2015 12:34pm","Thanks!  I have no issues with coffee notes but I was going for something more appealing to my friends.  My biggest fear was that it cancels out the Citra.  I am sure it will work out as you said.... we all know, there is no bad beer!  Thanks!",[]
21579,64567,deepdisco,"April 08, 2015  4:49pm","Hop Schedule table indicates dry-hop after 7 days, but Notes say to dry-hop during secondary after 3 weeks of fermentation.
Which route should I be taking with this?",['21612']
21612,64567,deepdisco,"April 11, 2015 12:01pm","erp - just realized that was *for* 7 days, not after 7 days.",['23751']
23751,71379,Sheldon Parker,"May 19, 2016  5:36pm","I always dry hop in secondary for no more than 2 weeks. any longer and it could effect the hop profile ( grassy, musty, vegital flavors/odors ).",[]

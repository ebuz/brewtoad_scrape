23277,20148,Kyle J.,"January 24, 2016  6:14am",I have a 15 gallon fermentor that I used as a primary. It was an explosive fermentation. I recently rebrewed this for the arrival of my second son (Ryddik). But this time i split the orange peel half and half between sweet and bitter and used WLP570 Belgian Golden Ale yeast. I also decided to cold condition it for three months around 40 degrees and then add oak for about a month. Its tasting really good as the original did. I recommend this recipe. But be patient with it and ferment on the higher end of the temp range 75ish. Hope you get to try it. Let me know how it turns out if you do!,['23340']

I'll bust out my brew band to keep fermentation temp up. I'm only set up for partial mashes so I am going to make some tweaks and try it...I'll let you know how it goes. And congrats on your sons birth!,[]

16784,1643,Michael,"January 06, 2014  2:57am","Infusion mash - 7 gallons of 160F water to strike at a temperature of 152F.  Mash for 60 minutes and mash out for fifteen with one gallon of boiling water.  No sparge - lauter the first runnings and bring to boil.  This is a 90 minute boil with hop additions at 60 min and 30 min.  As you are finishing collection of the first runnings heat five gallons of water to 160 and have 4 pounds Maris Otter or 2-row barley ready to add to the mash.  After lautering is complete add the grain and the new water and mash for 60 minutes, after 60 minutes add one gallon of boiling water.  I treated this second running as an IPA and hopped it at 60 with Columbus and then at 30 and 15 min with Cascade.  
I ended up with six gallons of the trippel with a gravity of 1.072 and 6 gallons of the IPA with a gravity of 1.048.
The second runnings IPA was racked onto the yeast cake of a wee heavy that was racked into secondary.","['17114', '17812']"

22498,1643,Michael,"August 04, 2015 11:36am",I brewed this again and had an OG of 1.080 for the tripel with the addition of one pound light candy syrup.  This ended with a final gravity of about 1.023 again which brings it to about a 9.2% beer.  Not hot at all.  Still getting up to optimal carbonation in the keg.  The second runnings became an ordinary bitter and had an original gravity of 1.040 and final gravity of 1.020 for an abv of about 3%.,[]

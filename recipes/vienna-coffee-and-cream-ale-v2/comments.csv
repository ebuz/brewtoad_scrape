I've tried other ways of using coffee, like throwing grounds in toward the end of the boil, or earlier, but cold brew is the best because you have total control of the strength.  I've played with different amounts and times, but 8 - 12 ounces of cold brew seems ideal. sometimes i make decaf, other times regular.  I make my cold brew coffee very concentrated, about twice the amount of grounds as if you were making french press coffee, and ground pretty coarse. I let it sit at room temperature for 24 hours and then strain.  Be sure to sanitize everything if making the coffee for beer use.  I also roast my own coffee beans, so that adds to the quality of the coffee as well, but I realize that's a whole other rabbit hole of a hobby... ha....
good luck!",[]

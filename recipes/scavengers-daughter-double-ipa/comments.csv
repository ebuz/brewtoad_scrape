23166,68507,Josh,"January 01, 2016  9:57pm",Missed it by a bit; I only got my mash up to 151 (Good enough for me). Since I missed that I decided to play around a little. I substituted the carared for corn sugar (1 lb) and got an OG of 1.1 & SRM 8.7. Made it a 90 minute boil also. Everything else I stayed true to the recipe.,[]

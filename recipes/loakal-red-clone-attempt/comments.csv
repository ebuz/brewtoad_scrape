17302,21173,Obsessed Brewing,"February 12, 2014  1:28am","My buddy and I brewed this recipe (with some small tweaks) and were very pleased with the result. It wasn't really like Loakal Red, but it was really tasty if I didn't tell anyone that's what we were going for. 
Instead of 7lbs of LME, we dropped it to 4lbs to get closer to the actual ABV of the Loakal Red (6.9%). The color was way too light for it to be a clone, and the complexity of the malt didn't come through. We cultured up the dregs from an actual Loakal Red bottle, and pitched that into the wort. Once fermentation was complete we dry hopped for a week, then added the oak cubes directly to the fermenter and aged for 3 months. Bottle carbed and started drinking.
If I told people that this was an Oak-Aged Belgian Pale Ale, they loved it. It was smooth and easy-drinking, had plenty of tannin and slight vanilla from the oak, and of course carried that unmistakable Bruery house character with their yeast. It went quick and I would definitely brew it again the exact same way, but wouldn't call it a red or a Loakal Red.
If I were to make a suggestion to get this closer to the actual Loakal Red, I would add 10oz of CaraMunich II to give it some more roast and color, or possibly 8oz of C60 and 8oz of C120 to develop some more complexity in the malt profile and give some extra body. The culturing up of the yeast was probably the single largest contributing factor to making the beer interesting, so I highly recommend doing that. If not, I have been told the yeast closest to the Bruery yeast is WLP510 Bastogne Belgian Ale, so I would recommend that over the WLP001 Cal Ale. I would also suggest not dry hopping until after the oak has aged for 3 months. We had almost zero hop aroma after waiting the 3 months, but that doesn't mean it didn't smell great. Huge vanilla, oak, and spicy Belgian yeast characters in the aroma were excellent, although not really the same as the fresh Centennial aroma of the real Loakal Red.
Thanks for posting the recipe, and hopefully something I wrote was helpful! Make sure to comment here if you brew it and have any suggestions to add.",[]

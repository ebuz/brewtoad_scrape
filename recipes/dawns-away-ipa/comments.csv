Wort stabilized at around 70F which is probably too hot.  I put it in the cooler filled with water and wrapped a wet towel around it.  tap water was at around 68F.   Put it in the bedroom where the fan is.  Hopefully that gets me to around 66 or so which is where I'd like it to be.  I'll check it late and if it's not working, I'll go to ice packs.",[]

Taste is strong grapefruit on the hop finish.  Lots of yeast still in suspension though, so we'll see how it is when it clears and then decide what/if to dry hop with.",[]

I took it out of the cooler and just let it rise to see if i could shave a point or two off of the gravity.  Forgot to check gravity when I kegge, but the airlock continued to bubble for quite a few days past 5/24.  It's possible that was just from degassing from the temperature rise.  I was careful to flush the keg with CO2 before transfer and before dry hopping.  I'll add the dry hops to the recipe.  I flushed the keg with CO2 and then pressurized it to 60 psi.  I'll leave it at room temp for the dry hop - about six days - and by then hopefully I have some space in the kegerator.",[]

I'll try to pull a pint to taste it to see where it's at carb, taste, and aroma-wise one of these days, but there's just no room in the kegerator right now.",[]

I just finished it and I am as close to heaven on this earth as i can be... :)   So I used Jim Beam Black Label and soaked the wood chips for 2 months... then when I racked the secondary I added the chips and let the beer sit for another 2 months... then kegged and now I am very happy!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!!!,[]

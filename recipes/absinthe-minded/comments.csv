18736,16090,Zack Knapp,"July 06, 2014  6:01pm","Sorry for the slow response... This beer ended up taking a turn for the worse. When I made it the bottles were severely over carbed and probably infected. Didn't get much licorice at all from it sadly. The ounce of Wormwood I believe over powered the undrinkable bitterness that the beer had. 
I've had the urge to make this beer again one day so I hope to do so in the future and it better somehow.",[]

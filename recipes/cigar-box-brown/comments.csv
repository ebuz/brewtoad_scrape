I am currently fermenting an india dark ale, and am inspired by Winston Churchill to age it on spanish cedar wood (from a cigar box) and johnnie walker red scotch (Sir Winston's favorite drink). I found this page after I came up with my recipe and realize it has some of the same ingredients. Curious to know your results!",[]

I am hoping for a strong enough coconut aroma with  just a mild flavor that doesn't overwhelm the hops or the malt.  Stone's version was very good though I really didn't get enough coconut though the tropical flavors were awesome.",['16446']

I actually just ordered all of the unique hops - well at least the Belma & Helga are unique - and I have the grains.  I am excited to brew this one... I have a few friends who have, but I haven't tried their renditions.  I totally agree with your take on the Stone version.",[]

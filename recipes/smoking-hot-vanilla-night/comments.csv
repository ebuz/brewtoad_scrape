I was thinking of using the liquid vanilla instead of the bean witch are costly .    then what's up with the chili ? do you boil the pepper chopped up or are you using powder? over all I'm thinking this may taste pretty good come fall time.",['18310']
18310,49508,raiderrob67,"May 30, 2014  4:40pm","No I have not brewed this. I saw a pic on FB yesterday that showed what they called a Mexican stout, it was only 3.8 ABV. there was no recipe so I tried to come up with something. I am probably not even close to what they had? what makes a beer a ""Mexican"" beer? there is no style category for Mexican/cerveza, I know they are lagers but that is about it. maybe they just made a stout and then fermented with Mexican lager yeast?",[]

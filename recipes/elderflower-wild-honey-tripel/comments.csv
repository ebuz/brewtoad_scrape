19842,8198,garrettbk,"October 30, 2014 11:43pm",I've used Elderflowers a few times and originally I thought 'dry hopping' with the flowers would get the best flavor/aroma. I ended up doing a little A/B testing and found that instead adding them for 60 min in the boil provided a great flavor. It really draws out all the fruity flavors from the flowers that way but I was also using dried elderflowers since getting them fresh isn't possible for me. Fresh flowers might work a little differently. And I would definitely use an 1 - 1.5 oz of them for 60 min.,[]

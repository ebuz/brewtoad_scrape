16271,22355,OvertonBrew,"November 22, 2013  4:13am","The name of this beer has two purposes, the first being that with the use of 4 different components to the grain bill and three different varieties of hops being layered in this brew it does have a lot of depth to its character. 
Secondly, it's my attempt to clone SN's Torpedo. I think it comes close, you know like close is good enough for horse shoes and depth charges (aka underwater grenades).",[]

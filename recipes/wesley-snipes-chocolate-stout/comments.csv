20205,41311,SeanKeith,"December 07, 2014  6:45am",I think if I were to try this again I would double the coco powder and add it closer to flameout. I would also suggest tasting it before moving to the secondary/bottling to see if it needs any extra chocolate. I have also read that cacao nibs work much better than powder but I have never worked with them.,[]

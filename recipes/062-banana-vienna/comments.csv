(Threw a heat belt on the bucket the first day) The room seriously smelled like banana bread after the first 24 hrs. I just brewed it a week and a half ago though so no tasting yet, but I'll update when I do.",['20136']

20249,35657,NikschBräu,"December 12, 2014  3:01am","Just tapped this keg... I have to say it really did turn out great. None of the flavors are in your face, but they are all clearly present and well balanced.. bready toastiness from Vienna and Munich malts, sweetness from crystal malts, fruitiness from special B and banana esters, subtle spicy clove and cinnamon, faint vanilla...
Originally, I was brewing this as more of a ""have just one in the spirit of the holidays"" kind of beer, but I could definitely keep putting these down. It came out surprisingly, highly drinkable.",[]

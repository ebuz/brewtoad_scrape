21377,28242,klibeson,"March 23, 2015  2:59am",I'm looking to brew something very similar to this and wanted to know if you had a follow up on how it turned out. Were you happy with the malt you used or would you suggest another based on the results?,[]

I was very happy with the Crisp ""Maris Otter"" Malt, it came from a fresh sack at the LHBS.  The malt didn't overpower the hops, and fit in pretty subtly.  The beer was clean, crisp, and easy drinking.  Something about the restraint with ingredients, made this recipe turn out better than most of my other hoppy beers.  It actually had balance.  Hope you enjoy!",[]

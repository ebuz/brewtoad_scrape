I racked into three six gallon carboys instead of two so there would be plenty of head space (and no clean up)  that worked really well.  I saturated the wort with pure O2 before pitching.  I rehydrated the dry yeast with water and a dash of olive oil before pitching.
When I bottled I used CBC-1 bottling yeast and bottled at 2 carb units. (maybe should have gone just a little higher on the carb but I like them not too foamy)",[]

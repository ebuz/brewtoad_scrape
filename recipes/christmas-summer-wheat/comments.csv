It came out pretty nice, fermented reasonably warm so lots of banana esters from the Mangrove Jacks M20. The spicy coriander came through (although I should have cracked them more) but the orange didn't, so in future I'll use more zest (I used the zest from one orange and one mandarin). Nice and sippable though.",[]

23799,56476,Anders Holthe,"May 28, 2016  8:16am","This really became a strange hybrid. I actually used both czech lager yeast and safale 05 ale yeast! i used waay too much Blackprinz, but now 4 months after, the blackmalt-taste (wet wool) has decreased and I enjoy it with barbeque-food!",['23809']
23809,1713,David Mann,"May 31, 2016  6:43pm","It's interesting that you thought the blackprinz was too heavy handed.
You used just a little more (in terms of percentage of grist) than i did, but not enough to make that much difference.
The difference could be the yeast. Both the 05 and the czech lager are higher attenuating yeasts. Maybe they stripped out some of the supporting flavors that would have otherwise supported that much blackprinz.
Glad it turned out in the end; cheers!",[]

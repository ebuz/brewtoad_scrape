24345,34830,bradherzberg,"November 06, 2016 10:24am","well - I've never had Julius so just trying to get close based on what I know about it.   My clone was decent, but sadly not what I was shooting for.   The main difference was it finished high (1.020).  This left it maltier than it should have been.  It was relatively hazy though but also too dark in color ( hard to hit colors with extract).   More later when I can get to a computer to type easier...   Thanks!",['24346']

24362,34830,bradherzberg,"November 11, 2016 12:33am",Let me know how it turns out!   I plan on trying this again soon as I saved the yeast.  Would be cool to hear how yours goes...,['24464']
24464,4267,Stone128,"December 10, 2016  1:23pm",This turned out really great.  Color was much darker as you described but the flavor and aroma is fantastic.  I  whirlpooled the 3 oz at end at 120 degrees.,[]

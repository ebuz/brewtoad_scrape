24715,104363,Elizabeth De Lyser,"February 27, 2017 10:27pm","Made this for a fancy Harry Potter themed evening party to great success!! I left out the cloves (I'm allergic) and Irish Moss (couldn't find any). I couldn't find vanilla beans, so I just added 2fl oz of vanilla extract at the end when I added the whole thing of butterscotch schnopps.
The beer was delicious!! People were begging me to give then a growler at the end of the party. I highly recommend this recipe - it's great beer, authentic to Harry Potter, and tastes amazing.","['24956', '24958']"

24965,104363,Elizabeth De Lyser,"May 09, 2017 11:57am","Like a normal beer, mostly? Added the mashes and dissolved at appropriate times, added the lactose at 15, added the hops and other flavorings (cinnamon, etc.) at appropriate times, and brewed for an hour. 
The main thing was I had to strain everything when getting it into the fermentor, because the cinnamon and nutmeg left a lot of undissolvable residue floating around. THAT was a pain. 
But it went pretty much like a regular beer. After three weeks, I added the vanilla and the butterscotch.",[]

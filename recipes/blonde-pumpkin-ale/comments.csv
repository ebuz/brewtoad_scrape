16468,40549,Spencer Fogg,"December 09, 2013  4:40pm","Monday, December 9th - Bottle conditioned for 17 days, the past 36 hours they have been in the fridge. Zero carbonation among the first three bottles. First two bottles showed a bit of floating debris, the third bottle has no debris in it whatsoever. The aroma is festive with spice. Mouthfeel is weak, watery but the pumpkin spice is eminent. The flavor is tasty enough that I keep wanting to drink it, but the lack of carbonation is a buzz kill. The color is spot on for what I was thinking it might come out like; a nice burnt orange with minimal cloudiness.",[]

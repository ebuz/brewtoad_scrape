23129,22525,Derek Gillespie,"December 27, 2015  7:55pm","Yes, that is smoked peated and it is a lot.  This gave it a leathery/sweet taste that dominated the beer.  I would definitely drop to 1.25 max if you keep the peated and lower the biscuit too.  The problem with having so many specialty grains is that you won't reach your OG and the beer will have too much flavor/sweetness.  I've been going back to basics this past year and been brewing beers from Palmer's Brewing Classic Styles.  You might find a happy medium by making a unique recipe from this and his.  Cheers!",[]

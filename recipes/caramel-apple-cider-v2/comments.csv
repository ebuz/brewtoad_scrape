23177,29467,Brumanchu,"January 03, 2016  5:25pm",I carb this in the bottle and pasteurize so the yeast metabolizes some of the available sugar in the Apple concentrate.  Since you'll be kegging you might want to taste test with fewer cans of Apple concentrate to get the sweetness to your liking.  I'd start with 3 and add to that in the keg.  Good luck!,[]

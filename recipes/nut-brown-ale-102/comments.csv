16828,45002,Jrod,"January 09, 2014  8:30pm",Pretty good.  It tasted nutty and a bit biscuity with a nice mouth feel from the oats.,[]

22449,64281,Casey Miller,"July 27, 2015  5:36pm","It is a very subtle vanilla taste that has a great mouth feel.  I loved the original recipe and after the first brew i have made this 3 more times with vanilla.  I went one bean the first time, then 2 the second time, then back to one bean because 2 beans almost seemed like too much.",['23681']

Do I need to steep some of the malt first, then stew the mash for 60 minutes? Or does it all go in together for the 60 minutes? Afterward, do I just toss in all of the hops into the boil? Any advice is really appreciated.

24417,45002,Jrod,"November 26, 2016  2:03pm","Hey R Menzel, 
This is probably a little late. You don't need to steep anything you just put all the malt in the mash tun with your strike water for 60 minutes. All the hops go in at the start of the boil for 60 minutes.
Did you end up brewing this? If so  how did it turn out?",['24426']
24426,98079,R Menzel,"November 28, 2016  1:19am","I did! I was majorly overthinking the steps. Once I simplified the process in my mind, it went a lot better (although I still had to sweat through primary--my airlock never bubbled, and in an opaque vessel to boot, so I didn't know if it was even going! Must have been a bad seal). Anyway, despite finding a few of the bottles had broken in capping when I tried to open them and having some wild differences in alcohol content between bottles, the beer is a hit. Not sure what I did wrong to have those happen, but for my first beer solo, I'm pretty pleased! 
Thank you for the recipe--I'll definitely be making it again!",[]

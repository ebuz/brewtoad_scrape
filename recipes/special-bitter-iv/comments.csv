Pitched at about 65ish F and put it in the spare room with a wet towel around it.  I'll keep an eye on it as I don't want it to go much over 66F.,[]

I swapped in a two piece airlock from the 3 piece and it's still chugging along.  Plan is to just let it ride until it's done.  Hopefully I can keg it next week sometime.,[]

Turns out I need to swap out the lines on the kegerator as well (left cider in them for months and it got nasty).  I need some new disconnects, tubing, etc.  so I have to get that stuff which is fine because the beer need to sit a bit while that yeast settles out.",[]

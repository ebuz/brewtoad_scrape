21686,9131,Teeerow,"April 19, 2015 12:36pm",So far so good. I'm aging it on the oak staves for 11 months so it won't be done until November. I sampled it recently and it was pretty delicious. Lighter on the bourbon side than I was hoping but I was going to add the cocoa nibs and coffee beans for like a week at the end and I'll probably soak those in bourbon before adding,[]

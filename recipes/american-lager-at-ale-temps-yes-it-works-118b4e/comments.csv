I start my late summer / fall lagers with 1 small batch 2.5 gallons of a 1 a or 1 b beer.  Then I brew 3 or 4 more batches on that yeast cake going up in of and color as I go.  So next weekend I'll brew 2.5 of my champagne lawnmower, then when I track to 2ndary, I'll brew standard, then standard again,  then fest bier, then dopplebock. Easy way to make lagers with out true lagering.",[]

21986,66580,FlyDoctor,"May 17, 2015  1:36pm","I'm confused about the organization of these recipes. As has been discussed at length on the BIAB forum in AUS, there are recipe details that are needed to make it ""high integrity"" like volume of ambient wort, volume into fermenter etc that allow people to truly reproduce a recipe. I would also suggest that volume of mash water etc be included. Otherwise it will be tough for the group to dial in recipes if we can't replicate them accurately",['22044']
22044,62371,David Stelting,"May 24, 2015  7:53pm",check out the improvements that BrewToad made to its brew log section.   very impressive.,[]
21992,62371,David Stelting,"May 17, 2015  8:52pm","I agree ago of that information should be in the recipe.  Click on the other tabs for wort and mash information.   We are even asking Brewtoad stag to include options to record the mill information,  and to ads a high Krausen sugar addition option for fermentable sugars.  I think you'll find that all b of the needed informant is there If you surf around for a while.",[]

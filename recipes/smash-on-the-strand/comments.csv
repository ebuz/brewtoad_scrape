A week later not enough hopflavour.
I boiled 2 ltr water added the 80 gram dryhop and boiled 5 mins. Added 25 grams fresh hops and cooled and strained it into the beer.
Also added 35 grams fresh dryhop.
This should bring the beer down to just under 5%, hopefully with considerable more hopflavour.",[]

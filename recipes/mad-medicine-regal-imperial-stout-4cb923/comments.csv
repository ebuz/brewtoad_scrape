Seemed to go really good... We did however leaving a fair amount of sugar in the left over mash however...we did not want to overshoot our volume, however wee could have just boiled longer...next time.  Initial OG = 1.092.  Again, having issues with the fermentation stopping early.   Will again try to add more yeast and yeast nutrient....really want this one to dry out.",[]

Again....it brings into question if the Spectrometer is calibrated, or if I am not using correctly.   It certainly tastes like there is a lot of alcohol in this beer.  Numbers just don't make sense.",[]

26153,127883,Kerry,"July 25, 2018  7:24pm","I decided to split this batch and use two different kinds of yeast. One got Wyeast 3522 Ardennes and the other got Abbey II 1762. The 3522 presented a brighter, fruitier flavor. The 1762 was more malty and honey sweet. The 1762 we used fresh lavender, 6 sprigs for 24 hour in a one gallon secondary. Any longer and there would have been too much lavender flavor. Use less lavender in the future so there is more control over how much flavor is added.",[]

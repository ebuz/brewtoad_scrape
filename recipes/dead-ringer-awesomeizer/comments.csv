Steaped hops with hop strainer  in 150F priming sugar water (after cooling from boil).  Dumped tea into bucket then spargwd hops with boiling hot water.  Racked 2 week beer in and bottled on 09 Jan 2015.",[]

The extract kit always tends to be too sweet...I really don't like this kit.  The golden malt extract seems to be too caramelized.  It would be best to add the majority of the malt extract to the lastop 20 min of the bold to reduce caramelization.    The end impact is that the residual sweetness makes this a little too malty.  This would be an excellent all grain brew with 2-row base malt.,[]

1st, how did this turn out? sounds like a wonderfully refreshing brew! after years of brewing, i am still trying to nail down the best way to utilize coffee in beer. was it coffee-y enough?
thanks!",['17362']

First, it turned out great, this hop profile is basically my signature, and people seem to love it. It got a 38/50 in a bjcp event.
Second, I used closer to 8oz of the cold pressed, freshly roasted Ethiopian blend. It came through in the finish, for lack of a better term, dry tongue note you get from coffee. As you can tell, the malt profile is very pale, but the coffee gave a richness in flavor, not so much in aroma. If I make this again, I'll double the coffee, make it coffee apparent and not merely a tongue feel of dryness with a hint of coffee. 
Happy brewing! If you have any other questions, please let me know!",[]

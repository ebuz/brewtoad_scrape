Just wanted to pick your brain about it. Did it taste close to Collective Arts? State of Mind is, by and far, the best commercially available Session IPA around right now. Would you brew it again? Would you make any tweeks to your original recipe? Also, are you only fermenting for 7 days? Any help would be great.
Thanks,
Duncan

They have since added Mosaic to the recipe (printed on the can) but it isn't updated on their website.
grain bill is the same.  I'm doing 1 oz of Centennial, Mosaic and Amarillo each at 15 min, 0 min and dry hop after primary.
wish me luck.",[]

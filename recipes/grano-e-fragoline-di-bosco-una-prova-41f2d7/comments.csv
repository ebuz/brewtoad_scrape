24074,50854,John R.,"August 23, 2016 10:51pm","So this beer over attenuated. It was water thin with a higher acidity content than preferred. Future variants would benefit from a higher strawberry:raspberry ratio in this regard as the strawberry aroma was practically nonexistent. It's contribution was likely limited to color which had a lovely opaque pink to it. Despite its lackings, it was popular with those with light palates. Considering that its hop content and malt profile were so low, people found it very refreshing in the hot summer. I expect the fruit flavour to fade fairly quickly and as such, do not allow it to sit/age for long. Delicate aromatics are not preserved at this ABV therefore, store in fridge post-carbonation. I went for a ~3vol CO2 which worked out well but because I accidentally mashed too low/too long, there were no proteins to really support the head. This high of carbonation would also contribute to the acidity level therefore, take note in samples prior to bottling in case treatment or blending is necessary.",[]

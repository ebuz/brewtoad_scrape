The initial bite of the hops is almost too much but it doesn't linger for too long and the flavour really becomes evident and quite pleasant. Every sip gets better, this will definitely be a regular on the roster of beers I make regularly. I would say that this is a good beer for people who aren't huge IPA fans.",[]

and 149 °F (63 to 65 °C).
- Use sugar for 10 to 20% of grist. Use the right sugar.
- Spice with care, if at all.
- Pick a yeast with the flavor characteristics you want.
- Don't be afraid of higher fermentation temperatures, pitching
lower than the low end of the recommended temperature range
and allowing the temperature to rise throughout fermentation.
- Allow for longer-than-average secondary fermentation and
further long cold conditioning before bottling.
- Bottle-condition, re-yeast when bottle-conditioning, and
condition to high levels of CO2 in a warm room. Let the beer
continue to condition at a cooler temperature after it has
carbonated.",[]

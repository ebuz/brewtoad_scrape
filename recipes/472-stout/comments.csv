Single grain move is classy.",[]

This looks like a good recipe",[]

This is a new experiment for me... ""Toasty, biscuity, sourdough, tangy 50L"" is how they describe it... seems like a good background note for a stout.
The HBC-472 hops are described as:
""Came to us from Select Botanicals Group's Hop Breeding Company (HBC) in the Yakima Valley. It is a wild American hop that is unlike any other. It is a subspecies of hop called neomexicanus and is the result of open pollination. HBC-472's unique character is commonly described as ""coconut and woody"". This is predominantly the result of a higher-than-usual Caryophyllene content that comprises about 30% of total oils. Test batches of aggressively-hopped IPAs lent big ""citrus and grapefruit aromas, but a fascinating whiskey/bourbon and coconut character break into the background."" This oak and coconut becomes more pronounced in darker malt-centric styles.""
I'm kind of excited to try to get a slightly hoppy stout out of that description.",[]

The hops are subtle compared to what I'm used to, but they seem like a really nice compliment. I can't necessarily pick out the special roast, but overall I'm really happy with the recipe, especially for being barely fermented.
Very smooth and chocolatey, maybe some subtle coconut too, but nothing overwhelming. 
So far has fermented to 1.012, so I think it will be quite drinkable...",[]

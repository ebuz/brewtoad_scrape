In the end, following the fermentation, I added first 4oz of cocoa nibs, and then a week later, 4oz of fresh ground (light roast) coffee, and 4 oz of american medium toast cubes soaked in Maker's Mark. That bitches brew sat for 3 months in the office until I got time to keg it yesterday, and taste it today.
I'm pretty happy with the result. There's clear coffee on the nose, and then chocolate and mild booze balanced with basic malt sweetness on the tongue. This is a keeper, and some that will be done again in the future.",[]

I will likely make some adjustments to the recipe after each brew.  Original name is ""35 Cent Ale"" but will be renamed if I can make it cheaper.",[]

It took about 25 days for the hops to mellow.  The yeast was very aggressive and despite a 65 df fermenting chamber, stayed about 74 df for the first 4 days.",[]

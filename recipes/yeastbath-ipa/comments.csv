Primary for one week, it overflowed A LOT. Lost about 2 gallons. It also exploded the airlock off the carboy. Luckily, I kept the carboy in the second bathroom's shower that never gets used. I had to take a shower in there to clean the ceiling and walls from the explosion. It clogged the drain, hence the name Yeastbath IPA.
Dry hopped, secondary for one week. Probably should have left it longer but I needed the gear to start a big batch for my wedding.
I tasted it at bottling. It was almost smoky tasting - not sure if I liked it. Very interested to see how it turns out.",[]

1. Boil 5 gal water with fruit until sugar dissolves
2. keep at 150 degrees for a day (how do you do that?) 
3. add yeast
4. put in carboy for _____ days?
5. keg or bottle?
When I do hard apple cider, I have put it in a keg so it can let off pressure when it gets above 120psi. When we first did cider we put it in bottles and they blew up because with so much sugar it just kept producing more carbonation. Do plums do the same?",[]

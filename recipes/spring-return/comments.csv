Really interesting looking at your hops schedule.  I don't think that I ever seen a recipe with the first addition at 30 mins, instead of 60 or 45. It must have a crazy great aroma with 5 oz all in late addition!
Is that something common to the style?
I've been trying to get myself to make a super low IBU beer but have a hard time laying of of the hops!  Maybe it's the chef in me to use them like seasoning, but I'm really interested in this recipe.  
I'm typically more in the 25-30 IBU range but I think that I'm going to try something lower than 20 for my lager attempt.
PS.  Saison fermentation is smelling better, but was super gnarly for a day and a half.  I'll sample when I rack it tomorrow.",['17644']

Plus I had all this Hersbrucker and Perle lying around that i've had for over a year and I wanted to just use it all up finally. ha.",[]

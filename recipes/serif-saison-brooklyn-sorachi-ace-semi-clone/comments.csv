Is this all done in the primary or do I have to secondary in order to do the dry hop? Also, i'm using a combo of grains in a mesh bag and extract (I don't have an all grain system yet) so i'm combining your recipe with another step-by-step recipe I found. Do you think that's a good idea? I would really appreciate your help and input, thanks!!",[]

17847,21838,James Ratzliff,"April 05, 2014  9:22pm","Just tasted first draught of this from keg.  Quite excellent.  Notes of espresso, dark chocolate, cola, and caramel.  Malty, but not sweet.  Fully carbonated.  3-4 cm of foamy head.  Nice lacing. Retains 1/8 inch of head while drinking.  Opaque deep brown color.  Aroma is roasted malt. Very refreshing!",[]

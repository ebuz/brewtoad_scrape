Could not find cita, label might have washed off. Adjusted recipe to reflect. Pitched 3 smack packs of yeast. Brew process went well, no problems. gave the chickens half the grain. Saved 25 gallons of water from the cooling for the chickens.","['26079', '26087', '26088']"

Tropical citrus, very slight pine notes to nose. Intense but clean and palatable bitterness. Does not come off overly sweet even at elevated gravity.",[]

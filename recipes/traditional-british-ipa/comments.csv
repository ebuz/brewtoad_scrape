Burton-on-trent was notoriously high in sulphates (and calcium, and other minerals), giving their IPAs a noticeable crisp bitterness. 4-6 grams would probably be safe, even if you water is already high in it, if it isn't, you could probably go 8 or higher, but in general, less is safer.",[]

It says it's 2/3 at the beginning of the boil, the rest in the hopback, then another 1-2 pounds of dry hops in the cask. These rates are all late 1800's for the Burton IPAs, I think there was quite a bit of variation throughout England.
Good book though... I hadn't looked at it in a while, but it's really interesting.",[]

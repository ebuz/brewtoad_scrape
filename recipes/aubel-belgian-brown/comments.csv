24456,22719,Crabby Abby Brewing,"December 07, 2016  4:28pm","Dec 6 - harvested the yeast (of course), then primed with 7 oz corn sugar, then bottled and kegged; FG was 1.009; will edit recipe to show higher attenuation; beer smelled really good, reminded me of the brown ale I had in Belgium...which was my goal! Taste was pretty good too...I didn't notice that the biittering hops were only half what they should've been",[]

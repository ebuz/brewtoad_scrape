17398,24435,akruspe,"February 20, 2014  9:40pm","If i remember correctly (its been a long time) I dont even know if I used the lemon peels, and if I did they dont have much to do with the flavour. Use a handful of peels if any. The star here are the citra hops. Incredible.",[]
17464,50912,Adam Scheidler,"February 26, 2014  9:01pm",@jsinning I added lemon zest from 3 large lemons (equivalent of 3 oz lemon zest) to my Witbier boil 5 minutes out. It definitely contributed to the aroma but the hops are what gave me most of my citrusy flavor.,[]
17964,52048,Trevor Lynch,"April 18, 2014  7:37pm",Anyone make this? How did it turn out? Ill be giving this a try in a few days.  Curious about the whole lb of honey malt.  heard it was powerful stuff,[]

18237,9810,slackerlack,"May 23, 2014  3:40pm",Is this still fermenting or have you been able to taste it?,['18251']
18251,54023,mbenda,"May 24, 2014  7:25pm","Drinking it right now. Nice body and it's definitely a saison. I only used a pack of the dried lemon peel from Brewer's Best, i think it was? Lemon flavor is kind of there. Nothing exciting, but it's a nice saison.",['18252']
18252,54023,mbenda,"May 24, 2014  7:30pm","Citra hops were a cool choice, my batch it didn't shine through as much. Can definitely tell it's there though. Oh, one more note.. I did use white labs belgian saison yeast.",[]
18343,52048,Trevor Lynch,"June 01, 2014  3:13pm",This was a great beer. Sad to see it go. I cut down the honey malt to 0.75 lbs and added a wee bit of coriander.  The yeast takes the fore front and there is just a hint of the citra hops.  Very nice,[]

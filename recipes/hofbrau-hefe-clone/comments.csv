Added 2 oranges zested and 1 large lemon zested, then added the 2 oranges and 1 lemon to the beer in the secondary.  Put the zest into a hop bag and added.  Gravity check was right at 1.013.  Fermented for one week at about 60-66 degrees F.  Temperature fluctuated as my house fluctuated.  Good fermentation after 12-24 hours of pitching yeast and lasted for 2-3 days, then slowed and finally all quiet after about 5 days.  Nice and cloudy during secondary racking.",[]

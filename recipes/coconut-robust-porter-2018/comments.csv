So I put the 14oz of coconut into the primary after about 10 days, and left it for about 1 week.  But when I went to rack into the keg, the coconut totally clogged up the siphon.  I was able to pump the beer through, but introduced a lot of air in the process.  And then the keg dip tube got clogged with coconut bits anyways, and I had to rack to a new keg.  Next time maybe put the coconut in a grain bag.",[]

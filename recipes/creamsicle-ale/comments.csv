18361,12379,Triplehorn,"June 02, 2014  9:46pm","Yep, 2 pods in boil, 2 in cask.  We usually brew 10 BBL batches of Cream, then rack off after secondary into a few Golden Gate quarter barrels, hop sock the additional flavor ingredients, cellar room temp for 2 weeks, then into the walk in for a week.  Without transferring to a bright, or complete crash with no gelatin, the beer maintains it's true feel; mouthy, suspended proteins, and a bit of yeast to carb the added corn sugar in the cask...

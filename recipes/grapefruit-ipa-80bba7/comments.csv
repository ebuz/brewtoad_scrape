23245,9037,Jmat,"January 16, 2016  2:32am",Brewed on 1/15/16.  Slight boil over issue but no big deal.  Pitched whole starter 1.2 L at high krausen.  It's at 64F.  Probably move it into the spare room to keep it cold.,[]

The grapefruit is the zest of 7 normalish sized grapefruits that was then soaked in some everclear grain alcohol.  I'll try t remember to weigh it.,[]
23381,9037,Jmat,"February 13, 2016  6:57pm",2/13/16 - it's kegged and dry hopped.  The grapefruit zest weighed about 3.6 oz. and that weight includes the everclear which was just enough to saturate the zest to sanitize it.  No more than an ounce.,[]
23427,9037,Jmat,"February 21, 2016  5:00pm",2/21/16 - pulled out the hops and zest two days ago.  Smells awesome.  It's in the fridge cooling.  I'll force carb once I finish up the pint or two of bitter that's still in the other kegl.,[]

Good stuff.  Darker than the grapefruit sculpin with some more malt character which I think is a good thing.  Still quite dry.   The perceived bitterness is mitigated by the grapefruitness which is, I think a good thing.",[]

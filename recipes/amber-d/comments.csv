A little light on the body and mouthfeel, but has a prominent boozy presence with a tasty sweetness and floral bitter.  Reminds me of a sweeter and hoppier Rogue Dead Guy Ale that I will definitely brew again.  Solid fermentation that began within 24 hours and let ferment 14 days in primary before kegging",[]

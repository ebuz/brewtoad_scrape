21987,8384,Dave Rogge,"May 17, 2015  2:03pm","Yeah, I just used celery seed that I got from an amish market or somewhere I could get a large amount for cheap.  I used about 1/4 lb for the IPA, and I just added it a few minutes before the end of the boil, like an aroma hop.  I was pretty happy with the result.",[]

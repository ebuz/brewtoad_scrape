With that said, I had several friends that said they enjoyed it and asked for more.  If I remember right, the slurry I made yielded about a quart.  If I do it again I will go half that.  I actually just gave my last one away this weekend.  Had I seen your comment sooner I would have been happy to send you one.",[]

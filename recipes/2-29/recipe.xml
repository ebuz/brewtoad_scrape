        <NOTES>A high yielding, high alpha acid American bittering hop. Also known by the trade name Tomahawk. One of the "Three Cs" along with Cascade and Centennial. Like the others it is citrusy and slightly woody. Columbus has a very high amount of total oils, and can impart a 'resiny' quality to a beer. Substitutes for bittering: Nugget, Chinook. Substitutes for aroma and flavor: Cascade, Centennial.</NOTES>

One of the "Three Cs" along with Centennial and Columbus. Named for the Cascade Range. Substitutes: Centennial and Columbus (but they have a higher Alpha Acid content).</NOTES>

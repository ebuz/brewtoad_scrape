In this variant I removed the Crystal malt and added some homegrown Cascades in the last 20 min.  The measurements of the Cascades are estimates but probably quite low.  Each ""2 oz"" addition was just me pouring in half of a gallon ziplock bag full.  These are homegrown hops from last year and I didn't find them all that flavorful or aromatic which is why I went so heavy.  
The wort actually came out to 1.074 OG and 1.014 FG.",[]

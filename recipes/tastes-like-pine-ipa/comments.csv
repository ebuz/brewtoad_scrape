I think the Citra black current flavor is piled unpleasantly on top of the Simcoe and Chinook pine.  This seriously tastes like a spruce tip IPA.  After a month in the keg the pine mellowed out but it is still too much pine.  Chinook, Simcoe, and Citra don't belong together unless you like pine sap.",[]

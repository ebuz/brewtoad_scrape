When I racked the beer onto it, fermenting stopped (Probably shocked yeast).  Several days later, still no fermentation.  Tastes nice and fruity after sitting on berries for 3 days.  The choice of a wit-raspberry combo is pretty sour... I like it.  Racked off and into carboy to cold-crash and condition.  The berries have left what was previously fairly clear, a cloudy (very raspberry colored) beer.  If anything, the body is a bit thin.  Next time I'd aim for an OG of 1.055 or so, and balance accordingly with more hops.  Perle seems a nice compliment though!",[]

Almost impossible to carbonate and serve because the entire glass ends up as foam.  The taste is really nice, and reasonably balanced, just a bit thin.  The combination of raspberries and wit-sour is fantastic, and a pound of raspberries per gallon is just where I want it to be.",[]

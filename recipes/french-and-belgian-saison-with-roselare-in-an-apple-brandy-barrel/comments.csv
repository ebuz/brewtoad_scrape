Appearance: orange hinting toward red.  Thin white head of micro-bubble concentrated around the edges of the glass.  Consistent bubbling from bottom of the glass. Aroma Sour fruit candy funk.  Dry sour cider.  Taste Honey, vanilla, slight sour tingle bubbly, rich with fruit flavor, apple.  Mouthfeel, smooth, easy drinking, clean and crisp finish.  Overall this beer kicks ass.  I wish the other pulls were this good.",[]

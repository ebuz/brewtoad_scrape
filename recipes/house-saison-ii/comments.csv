18884,31978,MarioM,"July 22, 2014  3:50am","I mashed low, 149 deg f for 90 min, and kept the carboy at 85-90 deg f with a fermentation heater and temperature controller during primary. Gravity stabilized well over 90% attenuation.  
It was the first time I had used that yeast so I fermented as if it was Wyeast 3724 Belgian Saison (Dupont), which is my favorite yeast and I recommend it. I consistently get 3724 to finish at 96-97 % Attenuation but requires high ferm temps. It does stall once in a while but I've noticed it performs great at 85 deg f without stalling and a 2 L starter. I brewed a batch 9 days ago and the gravity went from 1.054 to 1.004 today, 93 % Attenuation and plan on it dropping some more. Its been at 85 deg f from the start.   
Hope this helps.

Put in a 4 gallon pot for 14 minutes and then drained that.  messed up because i forgot to dechlorinate the sparge water.  mash water was dechlorinated so hopefully no big deal.  boiled for +1 hour.   Messed up and did late dme addition at 30, but compensated hops with a slightly longer boil.  added last .5 dme at 15 min.  used yeast extract.  cooled with the chiller.  worried about chlorophenals and color, but who know?  It'll probably be beer.",[]

Tasted it and it's pretty good.  I'd prefer more banana but it definitely still needs to clean up.  I'm going to leave it on the yeast for a few more days and then keg it.,[]

17426,47230,JoDo,"February 23, 2014  1:07pm","So far it's really good, a little sour but already a great stout. Needs about six months or more to age, plus needs the bourbon chips still. Really looking forward to it.",[]
17523,48182,GSharp,"March 03, 2014 11:10pm","I have never brewed a sour before... Do I need to use separate equipment to avoid funking my regular beers?  Did you use bottling yeast, and if so, what kind?",['17543']
17543,47230,JoDo,"March 05, 2014  6:17pm","Some like to use separate equipment, I just took special care to clean everything very thoroughly after. Don't use anything porous or that you can't completely sanitize (like wood). I carbonate from kegs so I don't use bottling yeast.",[]

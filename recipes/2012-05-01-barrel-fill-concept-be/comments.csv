18259,20812,jesran,"May 25, 2014  5:25pm",Barrel is French Oak that formerly held Amalthea Vineyards Europa wine (Bordeaux Style). In November 2013 pulled around 10 gallons of 60 gallons off. Kegged 5 gallons and bottled 5. Had to replace with 15-20 gallons of beer. So 5-10 gallons angel's share. Kegged beer is wonderful. Sour and barrel taste balance nicely. Strong beer for a sour. Probably 6-7% ABV. The body is fantastic for a sour. Not thin at all. There is an illusion of sweetness than cuts away to dryness upon swallowing. Just opened first bottle from this years bottling on 2014-05-20. Was even better than the keg. Just a superb sour beer. Goes great with food. Awesome after a good sweat.,[]

mash temp Heat water close to 170*(so temp is closer to 153-158)
for dryer styles mash at lower temp for more fermentable sugar(heat to 165 then will be about 150)
Mash a little longer then (15 more mins)
60 min mash 30 minuts sparge
sparge--heat water to 170--3 to 4 gallons
end up with 6 1/2 to 7 gallons
boil almost always 60 mins...except pilsner or wheat then 90 mins",[]

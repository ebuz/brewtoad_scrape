Temperature rose from 120 to 162 degrees with grains in the pot, held in the high 150s/low 160s for at least a half hour. Slowly decreased to around 149 degrees when the 60 minutes were up. Washed the grains with 1 1/2 gallons of hot water (probably 130 degrees max) and proceeded to the boil. The original gravity ended up being spot-on as predicted so presumably this poor man's mash worked to at least some degree.",[]

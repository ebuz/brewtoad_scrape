8.75 striked and 7 sparge to tip and pull 13. was perfect on a cold 30 degree day, on a 50 degree day ended up 13.75 without even tipping, so added 15 min to the boil and ended up with 10.5 gallons of 1064 wort both times. sparge water temp was 160, got it down to 153, ended at 151 for the first batch, and 152.5 ending at 150.5 on the second. 1 hour mash for both, clean iodine test for both. pitched 1 pack of s04 in 5 gallons for each, first batch at 68 and second at 72. 
first batch was at 1.024 one week in.
other difference, used magnum (1.25 oz) in the first and cascade (more hops 2.5 oz) for 20ish IBUs (a bit low due to higher OGs, 1061 expected and 1064 reached)",[]

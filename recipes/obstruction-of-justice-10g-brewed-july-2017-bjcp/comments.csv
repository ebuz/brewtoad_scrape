I would be safe with 153 and 160","['25068', '25069']"

25125,71349,spookify,"July 18, 2017 12:56pm","Pre-Carbonation/Pre-Cold Crash Tasting:
Chocolate coming threw very nicely and very noticeable.
Full-Bodied, Slight touch of pepper and vanilla to balance. 
Sweet but not overly sweet. (let hope that carbonation balances this even more)",['25148']
25148,71349,spookify,"July 24, 2017 12:58pm","First Semi Carbonated Tasting:
Batch A - Chocolate with Medium-Low Spice Profile. No Vanilla and Medium Cinnamon 
Batch B - Chocolate with Medium-High Spice! Possible got more Chili Seeds! Tried to measure chilies as best as possible however there is a noticeable difference in Spice between once batch and another even though the same amount of peppers were added. (Just something to keep in mind)
All in All - Very Very Good Beer. No off-flavors. Get fully carbonated and aged a little and this beer is a winner. 100% Brew again and honestly at this time I have no idea what I would change. Once fully carbed and BJCP feedback is back maybe I will have some tweaks but I think we set out and achieved what we wanted on our first try. (If anything its an amazing first try)",[]

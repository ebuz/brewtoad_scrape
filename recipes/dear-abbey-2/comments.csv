20347,54197,Webster,"December 21, 2014  9:07am",So the step isn't correct here but the temps and times are.  This was not the easiest achievement and the wort had a very tangy zest to it. Racking to secondary tomorrow and a taste. I start with infusion that is pretty thick 0.75qt/lb. Then add boiling water incrementally to hit each temp to a FC of 1.3 qt/lb. Once this thickness is reached I pull the grain in 4 qt saucepan and boil it 5 min then add back to mash. Repeat till I reach target. Slow process of about 2 hrs total. If I did it again I would pull 1/3 total grains for two step decoction after initial infusion,['20359']

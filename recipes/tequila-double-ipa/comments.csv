The brew turned out great!  If you like very hoppy IPAs, and also tequila, this brew would be well worth your time.  
The DIPA aspect Is excellent, particularly if you like a strong, hoppy brew... for me, there's literally no way a beer can have too much hop content (ok, maybe I'm exaggerating but you get the point).  
As for the tequila, I used a quality reposado (obviously 100% agave), and resisted the urge to overdo it.  Using the logic that you can always add more, but never less, I started with 5 oz, and never added another drop.  This provided the perfect hint of tequila flavor, without being overpowering.",[]

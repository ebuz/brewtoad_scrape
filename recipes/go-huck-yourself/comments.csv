20999,58004,redline,"February 22, 2015  4:05pm",It came out really nice. It looked like pepto bismal in the secondary before it settled out but it did settle out and had just a slight red color to it. Hucks weren't overpowering at all. I'd consider adding more next time. It was a hit with friends and family.,[]

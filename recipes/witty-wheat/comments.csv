21210,60247,lowlyjanitor,"March 10, 2015  9:30am",Bottled half of these with chilli's in the bottle. I highly recommend it. Used dry red hot chilli's sterilised in vodka. Recommend 2 per 500ml bottle for the ones to be drunk the first week or 2 and 1 per 500ml bottle for the rest. All the ones with chilli came out over carbonated after 2 weeks I assume because of the sugar in the chilli's but could have been unevenly stirred priming sugar because they were bottled first.,[]

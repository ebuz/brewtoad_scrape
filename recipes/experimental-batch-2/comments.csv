Swaen Munich was low also had under 1 pound so substituted remaining with an older Munich malt I had setting around that has a more bland flavor when tasting.,['26351']

Color is a bit lighter which I find more appealing.  More bitterness present.  Brew went really well. The two hour boil and stepped mash temps (151 for 45, 158 for 15, 168 for 15) makes this recipe feel like it takes a really long time.","['26352', '26405']"

Mouth feel semi sweet, slight slickness on tongue and leaves a mild sweet aftertaste.  Taste is malty sweet low bitterness up front, First flavor impression is Herbal hop with a sweet malty backing. Sweetness lingers, late hop bitterness follows.  Color is light to med copper.  Still some haze as transferring into secondary. Flavor is very different from the Fuggle batch.",[]

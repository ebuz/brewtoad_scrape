I put this stuff called clarity ferm in with the yeast (or whenever the instructions told me to).  It says that its an enzyme that breaks down the proteins and eliminate chill haze.  We'll see.  Supposedly that stuff also renders this beer effectively gluten free.  The gravity on this went rather low so it should be dry enough.  Unfortunately, I can't seem to find where I wrote down the FG and I apparently didn't mark it down here.  I bottled in Belgian bottles with cages and corks about four weeks ago and it was carbed as of last week.  Added some S-04 at bottling.  Used a little over a cup of corn sugar.  I threw a bottle in the fridge to try tomorrow.  When I tried it last week.  It was good but my thought was that it would definitely benefit from some cold conditioning or maybe just more time in the bottle (or both).",[]

While the taste was good, an unintended consequence of adding the Jaggery was a less appetizing color, which ended up being a hazy yellowish-brownish.
That fact, in addition to the Jaggery not being a typical Midwest ingredient, were likely the reasons that the beer did not place well in the Midwest IPA contest.",[]

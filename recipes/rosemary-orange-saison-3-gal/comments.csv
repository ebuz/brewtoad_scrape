I love Rosemary and use it a good deal in cooking.  I've always meant to try some in a beer but haven't done so.  Good luck with it and good brewing.",[]

18588,51469,clockworkjpm,"June 22, 2014  6:42pm","@brumanchu and @Bob.. added some tasting notes to the brew log.  I think this was a successful first attempt at this combo.  The aroma was very cool (essentially what I wanted) but was overpowering with this concentration.  We have fresh rosemary in our backyard, and I used dried orange peel from the spice rack. In a 5 gallon batch, the amounts in the recipe might have been better balanced.  
It was funny, the first few drinks were a ""6 oz of this is enough for one sitting"" kind of situation.  After 4 weeks in the fridge, the taste was still potent, but either the beer had mellowed substantially or I had gotten used to the potent aroma.  I'm thinking of re-trying this soon with reduced (by 1/2) orange and rosemary.",[]

Reading I see you saying you'd do a rosemary tincture, so I'm planning to do that. How about the orange peel? Is it literally just the rind?",[]

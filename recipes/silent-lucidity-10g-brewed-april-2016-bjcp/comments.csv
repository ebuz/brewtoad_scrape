2) (8/12) Butterscotch. Mild Funk Grass and Pine
Appearance 
1) (2/3) A bit of chill haze - ale for Nice Head
2) (2/3) Light Golden. Good Head
Flavor 
1) (12/20) Nice Malty Start. A bit of Acidity on the tongue. Perhaps a bit salty too. Check water. 
2) (8/20) Lemon/Citrus. Low Bitterness 
Mouthfeel 
1) (3/5) A little flabby - Could use more co2 
2) (4/5) Low Carbonation. Creamy Smooth
Overall 
1) (6/10) Nice Beer, needs some attention to detail. A bit of acidification of your brewing water.
2) (7/10) Good Example of Style with minor Flaws.",[]

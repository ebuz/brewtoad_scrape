Heat 15 qts. (14 L) of water to achieve a mash temperature of 153 °F (67 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes or until conversion is complete. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.6 L).
Boil the wort for 75 minutes adding hops with 60 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, aerate the wort with filtered air or pure O2 and pitch yeast.
Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). After fermentation is complete, transfer the beer to five 1-gallon (3.8-L) jugs and flavor as desired with Frangelico (hazelnut liquor), 100% raspberry jam, ""bloomed"" cocoa powder and vanilla bean, coffee beans, maple syrup, ancho peppers, etc. Once you're certain the final gravity is stable, bottle or keg each aiming for 2.2 volumes of CO2.

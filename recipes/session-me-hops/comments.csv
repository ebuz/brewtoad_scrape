In either case, I will probably brew this again, but with more base malt and increase the amounts of hops in the end to get a bit more hoppy aromas (or possibly dry hop for a week with either Citra or Falconers 7C's). Faconer's Flight is great all around type of hops blend that suits this brew perfectly. In either case, everyone that drank this brew it was really pleased with the taste.",[]

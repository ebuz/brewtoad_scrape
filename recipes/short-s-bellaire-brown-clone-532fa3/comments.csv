This recipe does not yield a beer similar to Bellaire Brown.  This is much darker, sweeter, less bitter, and the malt profile is more chocolate than the strong toastiness of Bellaire Brown.  Anyone working from this should bump up the IBUs and switch to lower SRM, nuttier malts.  You'll read on the internet that Bellaire Brown has very low IBUs - this is misinformation IMO.",[]

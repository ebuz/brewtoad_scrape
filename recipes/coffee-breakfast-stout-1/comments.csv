19081,20344,Alex,"August 07, 2014  2:41pm","Cold steeped all of the dark grains in the bill at a ratio of 1lb/2qts of water overnight in the fridge.  Next day strained the grains into the boil kettle and then added the grains to the mash during mash out and sparged over them as normal.
Mash was a bit loose an there was extra runoff since I didn't take into account the bit of extra steeping water and reduce the amount of water in the mash since the dark grains were steeped separately
Reduce down initial mash water factoring in the removal of cold steeping grains.
Also coffee additions were 2oz ground at Flame out and then added a cold brew with 2oz of coffee at a 1:16 ratio of coffee to water overnight in the fridge.",[]

Added 1/3 a cup of king's county bourbon when racking over.  Also cold crashed and clarified with gelatin before adding to the barrell",[]

I have a wheat extract kit, I am going to add 2 pounds of honey then follow your hop schedule
Have you brewed this exact recipe?",['20590']

If you haven't brewed it yet, I would suggest adding the honey with only about 2 minutes remaining in the boil.  The honey doesn't add a HUGE amount of flavor; it's not supposed to.  Generally, the honey dries out the beer, being almost 100% fermentable, its job is to add a little alcohol kick without harshness; it makes it a smoother flavor.  You will get a little bit of flavor out of the honey, depending on what kind of honey you use.  I would always suggest local honey, nothing from the grocery store if you can help it.  As for the hop schedule, it will blow you away.  All the floral notes of what is left from the honey, mixed with the Cascade and Falconer's is freaking awesome.  This one didn't last long around my house.  Let me know how it turns/turned out!  Cheers!",[]

Most of all, the beer was really smooth and easy to drink",[]

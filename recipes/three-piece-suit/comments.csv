It's recommended, if you want to do so as well, that when you are putting the beer in the carboy to reserve about 8oz in a sanitized erlenmeyer flask with an airlock, after the enzyme and yeast is *thoroughly* mixed in. Keep it handy, agitate whenever you walk by it. The flask brew should be completely fermented in just a couple/few days and that will let you know what your final gravity on the carboy will likely be. I've read that you should bottle it with a couple hundredths of gravity left to go.",[]

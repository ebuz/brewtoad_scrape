20275,46350,SEATTLEBREWING,"December 14, 2014  5:58am",How mature is the batch now?  Any flavors that really shine?  What do you think of the esters of the 1968 and what was the FG when finished.  :D,['20281']
20281,2193,Pooka_NC,"December 14, 2014  6:53pm","It just carbed up and I started drinking on it last week. It's a Sweet, Malty, Bready Brown Ale Flavor from the Mild, Biscuit and Brown Malts. The Toasted Oats lend to the Cookie Flavor. I get a touch of Molasses from the Brown Sugar and some Dark Fruit and Raisin character from the Crystal-120 and D-90 Belgian Candied Syrup. The London Ale Yeast is perfect for this type of beer and the Esters are there but blend nicely with the overall flavor profile of the beer. The 6 oz tincture imparts just a touch of Spice Flavor,  it's not a Spice Bomb Beer. I'd describe this beer as subtle and  very sessionable. The FG was 1.022. I think it's in the 5.5-6.0% ABV range since I got low efficiency and added the Belgian Candi Syrup for more flavor and gravity. I'm very pleased with it.",['20282']
20282,46350,SEATTLEBREWING,"December 14, 2014  8:33pm","Very nice explanation and details. I'm in, I'll put it on the calendar. We took on an additional 155 gallons of fermenter space for a total of 190 gallons. We haven't done anything less than 10 gallons so I'll tweak this for something midrange in size.  I think I'll had a little allspice also.",['20303']
20303,2193,Pooka_NC,"December 16, 2014  4:07am",Cool. I think Allspice will fit right in with the rest of the Oatmeal Cookie Spices. Let me know how it turns out for you.,[]

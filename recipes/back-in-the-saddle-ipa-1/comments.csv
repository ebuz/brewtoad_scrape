18743,54102,Mattzm,"July 07, 2014  8:57am","Undershot gravity a little due to screwy thermometer readings but fermented all the way down to FG in 2.5 days. 007 is a beast of a yeast. Waited another week before CC to let the yeast do their cleanup.
 Honestly, am very surprised by this beer. Rich almost red colour, pours relatively clear after cold crash before kegging (eschewed gelatin this time, small amount of yeast floaties). Head retention is ok and has lacing. Still dialing in pressure with gas board. Relatively minimal hop character, none of the lemony taste that Sorachi is supposed to impart but a smooth slightly bitter flavour that honestly comes out almost chocolately. Eminently drinkable and smooth and does have some nice hoppy aroma as it warms. Suitable as maybe an introductory IPA for those who aren't fans or could be dry hopped to make it extra aroma good.",[]

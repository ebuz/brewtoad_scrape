19766,9037,Jmat,"October 25, 2014  5:54am",Brewed this about two weeks ago.  Went fine tried to keep temps down in low 60s initially.  Eventually rose to around 68.  Gravity is abou 1.000 or 1.010.  Didn't take an OG so that's not too helpful.  Still a little yeasty but clean.  Lots of bitterness up front.  Malt flavor is clean but not as sweet as I expected given the amount of crystal malt I used.  This may improve with a bit more time.  I recall that happened with the original Mai guy.  Plan is to keg it in the next day or two then force carb and cold condition.,[]

Cheers!

Tastes delicious out of the bottling bucked; we figure 2 - 3 weeks before we can start drinking it.  The decoction seems to present itself as a roasty nose.  Malt is pervasive in the smell and throughout the taste.  Nice body, no alcohol heat and supremely tasty.  We're pretty darn pleased.",[]

Happy brewing -

18485,48644,discoveringbeer,"June 13, 2014  5:59pm",This is an enhancement to my original Tropic of IPA recipe. I bumped the Caramel 20L to 2 lbs for some extra sweetness.  Added oats to the recipe to improve the mouthfeel.  Substituted in an ounce of Amarillo for Citra to hopefully get an orange citrus taste to blend with the lime/pineapple taste from the Citra.,[]

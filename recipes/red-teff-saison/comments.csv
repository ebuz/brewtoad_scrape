I didn't do a cereal mash, but it probably would be a good idea, especially if you are going with a higher percentage than I did (I considered it to be more of a flavor addition than a fermentable).
The flavor would be hard to describe, especially since I finished this batch a couple years ago... I want to say it's a little bit similar to rye, but maybe a little more earthy. It didn't necessarily evoke Injera, which is my main experience with Teff outside of this beer, but I'm sure you could find parallels if you had them side by side.
It would be really interesting to get a hold of some naturally fermented injera batter, preferably from a long running Ethiopian restaurant. I bet there would be some nice wild microbes that would compliment those flavors and make a funkier saison than I had (mine was more like a Red IPA, which was awesome, but maybe not what everyone looks for in a saison)
Overall, I enjoyed it, and it seemed to be popular with my friends, so in general I would say it's a worthwhile experiment.",[]

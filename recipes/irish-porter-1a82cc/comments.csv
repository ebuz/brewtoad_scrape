 1st place winner from judges (brewers at No Worries and Two Roads). 40/50, 41/50.
Both commented it is well balanced but a little over-carbonated and could use a little fuller body/flavor. 
If I were to brew it again, I'd lower the amount of priming sugar, and add a little bit more brown and chocolate malts, maybe 2 lbs Brown, 0.5 lbs Black, 0.75 lbs Chocolate",[]

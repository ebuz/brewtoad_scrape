I was thinking about doing a Berliner Weiss (GF) too and your fermentable bill happily confirmed what I suspected might be appropriate.  I was also thinking about racking onto fresh raspberries in secondary which are coming into season.",['18624']
18624,25601,Phil Krooswyk,"June 26, 2014  9:08pm","Hello! This recipe is my go-to. I make it all the time and it has a permanent tap on my kegerator. I actually aged my most recent batch in secondary with raspberries and it turned out great. The key is to not let this sit too long in fermentation or it might develop some bitter aromas - more like a lightstruck lager. Because there is so little malt, don't let it sit too long before you bottle or keg it. It really shouldn't ferment for more than 10 days. Enjoy!","['18628', '18721']"

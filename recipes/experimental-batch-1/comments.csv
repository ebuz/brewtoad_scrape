26403,47564,jjbair,"November 15, 2018  6:36am","Dry hopped on the 11/5/18 before work.  Transferred to secondary on the night of 11/14/18 (midnight). Gravity Reading 1.017 at this time. Clean dry mouth feel, no dialectal.  Low residual sugars and strong bittering finish. Earthy hop flavor with lemon notes in finish but overall bitter impression. Color light to medium copper, still some haze present but has secondary and cold crash in keg still.  Sweet caramel aroma with subtle malt notes, no notable hop scent. Pleasant warming alcohol presence.",['26404']

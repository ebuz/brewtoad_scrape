22005,54490,Leo Domenic,"May 19, 2015  9:12pm","London Ale yeast provided too much fruitiness for what I wanted. This is probably due to me reading the WLP vial that said to pitch at 70-75F and having the fermentation run warm for the first few days. Regardless, esters in a stout are good but not a cacao/vanilla stout. After a half bottle the fruity-sour taste lessens and the vanilla and cacao comes out more.
Split batch 4 ways:
2gallons - 2x cacao - okay not favorite
1 gallon   - 1x cacao, 1x vanilla- favorite
1 gallon   - 1x vanilla - 2nd favorite (tie)
1 gallon  - 2x vanilla - 2nd favorite
Cacao seems to add some acidity
All provided great aroma
Vanilla was lovely but subtle
Minimal head formation/ retention",[]

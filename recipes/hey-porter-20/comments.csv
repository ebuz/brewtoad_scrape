============
Aroma: Sweet, chocolatey, pretty estery, maybe buttery.
Flavor: Sweet, kind of malty, a little chocolatey, a little bitter. One-dimensional. The aftertaste is sweetness and esters, where more hop bitterness would be nicer. 
Mouthfeel: Good carbonation, a little thinner than most porters, but not in a bad way. (For Cory it might be in a bad way)
Appearance: Very nice head when poured from the tap, clear and dark. A good color for a porter.
Overall: Drinkable but one-dimensional. Too sweet, chocolatey, and estery.",[]

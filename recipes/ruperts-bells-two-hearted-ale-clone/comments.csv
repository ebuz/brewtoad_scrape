I will try this in 2 weeks once my carboy is freed up from my current batch? How does it compare in taste with Bells?,['20824']
20824,63238,Rupert,"February 07, 2015  9:27pm",It is an easy recipe. I've brewed this 3 times and everyone love's it. Bells is hard to come by in Maryland so I don't get a chance to do a taste comparison often. My well traveled friend declared my last batch a dead ringer for Bells. I'll take that:) Let me know how it turns out for you.,[]

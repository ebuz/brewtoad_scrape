Would back off bitterness addition if planning on a whirlpool. That said, huge aroma and hop presence. Before kegging flavor was mostly pine and grass. After chilling and kegging, flavor was melon, pine, grass and citrus. Beautiful Orange tint. Mosaic is a wonderful hop, and this recipe will provide you the unobtrusive base to allow it to shine.",[]

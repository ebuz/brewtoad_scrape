RO water treated with ¼ tsp 10% phosphoric acid per 5 gallons
1 tsp CaSO4 in mash
Mash technique:
Infusion, mashout, crystal malts added at vorlauf
Mash rests:
149°F (65°C) 60 minutes
168°F (76°C) 15 minutes
Sensory Description: Has the bready, biscuit malt, floral, woody hops, and fruity ale
character so classic in English bitters. Enjoy fresh after it has dropped bright. Lovely
on cask without a sparkler. I often serve it directly from the cask on gravity feed
without a beer engine. Serving at cellar temperature (55–58°F /12–14°C) allows the
malt and fruity qualities to open up and better support the hops.
Formulation notes: The British base malts have more of a bready, biscuit flavor;
blending them adds complexity. The darker crystal malts give some extra color, as
well as dark caramel and toffee flavors. The percentage of crystal malts isn’t that high,
so don’t expect a lot of body and sweetness. Yeast adds a supportive fruitiness, but the
hops come through with their floral, fruity, and woody qualities. This style is
traditionally dry-hopped when served on cask. The Fuller’s yeast strain (Wyeast 1968
or White Labs WLP002) is a superb cask strain; it flocculates very well.
Variations: I really like this recipe the way it is, but there is some variation in crystal
malts between maltsters. The crystal isn’t a dominant flavor, so you can really use just
about any British maltster. Some of the very dark ones can be a touch burnt, so I prefer
to add them at vorlauf rather than in the mash.
Fermentation and Conditioning
Use 5 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, 1
liquid yeast package, or make an appropriate
starter. Ferment at 68° F (20° C). When finished,
carbonate the beer to approximately 1 to 1.5
volumes and serve at 52 to 55° F (11 to 13° C).
Since this beer has a fairly light body, excessive
carbon dioxide can make it seem extra thin, harsh,
and hard to drink. With the right level of CO2, the
body of the beer will be just right, and it won’t
seem watery or harsh.",[]

25296,124917,Jim,"September 20, 2017  1:43pm","I have a few questions. This stout seemed like a great first try. It seems like a slow process. Barely any valve activity. In seven days I will check the SG to see if fermentation has dropped the level, but with such a high OG reading what am I looking for? When I put it into secondary should the nibs be added on the first 3 days and how long should it remain in secondary after removing the nibs? I've read about very long periods of time for bottle conditioning. What is recommended for this brew? Thanks Jim",[]

If you are not able to drink it withing 3 weeks (6-10 weeks old), I would maybe try Maris Otter instead of the Pilsner Malt, to boost of the long term maltiness of it. It's a bit of a color trade-off, but not much. I would also First Wort Hop (FWH) the Centennial drop at 75 minutes to contribute more to the taste. This really is a nice solid beer as it.. but like an Enjoy By, it's better the younger it is. Around 4 to 5 weeks in the keg the hops fade and the beer is left tasting like coconut and alcohol.",[]

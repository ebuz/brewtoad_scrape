The plan was to harvest and process local acorns by leaching out the oils then grinding them into acorn meal.  If you do decide to make this please let me know how it turns out for you and any changes you might suggest.",[]

I have done a lot of research and I think I have the perfect combination of malts, hops and yeast picked out for the best results... How do i know how much of what ingredient to put in? none of the recipes on here come with directions...",['19591']
19591,16665,CI Brewer,"October 08, 2014  1:39am","The short answer is trial and error.  Make your best guess as to what ammounts to use for the flavor you want, and make adjustments each time you brew to hit the mark you're shooting for.  The brewing calculator here works pretty well for estimating  O.G., IBUs, and F.G. for what ever recipe you put together, but as far as final flavor goes there's no way to tell until it's been made and you drink your first pint.  Hope this helps!",[]

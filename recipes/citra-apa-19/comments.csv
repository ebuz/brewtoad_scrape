  Now when I use wheat I try to give the wheat a ""protein rest"" at about 130 for 15 min, this will help it convert latter in the mash. To sum it up I got lazy when typing up the mash schedule , still getting used to this site. by the way when I try to scroll though the fermentables / hops / yeast page in new recipe  it will not scroll down, do you know why?",[]

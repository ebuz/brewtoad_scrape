21826,52245,Phillip,"May 01, 2015  8:36pm","Grassy, rasin character with hints of plum/prune. Belgian character is present with bitterness lingering in the finish. A little hint of buttery/margarine. I'm hopeful that the beer will mature well in the next few weeks. I've turned down the heat to about 76 degrees F.",[]
21888,52245,Phillip,"May 07, 2015 12:12am",Grassy with hints of pepper and perfume. Very low ABV tasting with an extremely light body and mouthfeel. Up front bitterness in the first sip with a numbing sensation in the aftertaste.,[]

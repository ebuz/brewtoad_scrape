25844,25850,CorySchulz,"March 20, 2018  2:16am",This looks like a solid recipe. I’m looking to do something similar. I want it to be dry and creamy and really let the coffee shine through. I don’t want the sweetness from the malt or flavor from the hops to have the focus. How does this one usually turn out? I was thinking to do the coffee in a French press and pour it in but cold brew can be pretty smooth too.,[]

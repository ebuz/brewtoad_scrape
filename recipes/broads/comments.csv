Each year at a brewfest our brewing group does we have to make at least one fruit beer because 75% of the audience is women (the fest is to raise money for the Humane Society and it often occurs the night that deer season starts). The experienced brewers in the group always says, if we don't have at least one fruit beer, we might as well shoot ourselves in the foot. We also have to make sure our winemaker is well stocked and he usually has a line.",[]

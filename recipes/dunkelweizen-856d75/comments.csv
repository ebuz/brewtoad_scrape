24259,27476,Seabrew,"October 13, 2016  6:20pm","The beer turned out well, though I will likely change the recipe when I brew it next. The caramel note of CaraMunich were too much, so I would 1) reduce it from 6% to 3-4% or 2) remove it altogether and change the last sacch rest of the mash from 148-150 degrees to 155 degrees. The lengthy mashing steps I outlined provided enough caramel/melanoidin that the CaraMunich might only been needed if you are planning a single temp mash.
The second thing I would change would be to try a different yeast other than WLP 380. It was a good yeast, but I want to try a more traditional yeast such as WLP300.",['24261']
24261,98675,Joey Romanelli,"October 14, 2016  2:37am","Ok gotcha... yeah I was thinking something like Dark Wheat 6lbs, Munich Malt 4lbs, Cara Munich 1/2lb, Carafa 1/2lb, Chocolate Malt 1/2lb and Caravienna 1/2lb... Hallertau 1oz and Tettnanger 1oz... and WLP #300 Hefeweizen...","['24262', '24265']"

24265,27476,Seabrew,"October 14, 2016  1:41pm","I haven't compared red wheat vs white wheat vs dark wheat, but I think you can go with any type of malted wheat. The Munich and Vienna are somewhat interchangeable in the recipe, depending if you want more maltiness (Munich) or toanstiness (Vienna). I went with a mix. 
The style calls for no roasted character, and I have found that Chocolate Wheat can be soft of roasty depending on the type you go with. There are lighter types that don't provide as much roastiness. I assume you are talking about Carafa I. I try or a mid range color to style. If you add too much dark malt or caramel malt, you cover up some of the best parts of the beer. +8% caramel malt also seems a bit high and may overpower the yeast character. Most traditionally made beers of the style have little to no caramel malt. I think my beers are better when I remove/lower the amount of caramel malts. Melanoidan Malt is a possibility if you want some melanoidan character. I suggest The following:
Malted Wheat 6 lbs, Munich Malt/Vienna Malt 5 lbs, CaraMunich/CaraVienna 0.6 lb, Carafa/Chocolate Malt 0.4 lb,  Optional Melanoidan Malt 0.2 lbs
Hallertau or Tettnanger could work, but you prob don't need both. The style calls for 10-18 IBU which 1 oz of either would likely give, depending on the AA of the hops.
WLP #300 Hefeweizen is a classic choice.",['24272']

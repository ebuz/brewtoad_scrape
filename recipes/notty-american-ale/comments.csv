I like buying buy the pound to save money and brew a bunch of beers with one hop being the same. this way I get to know how to use certain hops. the last one I used a lot was cascade, now I'm kind of sick of them so I figure centennials are next.",['18435']

18550,54829,grainy,"June 20, 2014  2:09pm",I planted nugget hops 1+ years ago. planted the nuggets because they are said to be disseize resistant and will use them for bittering. I figure free bittering hops are the way to go. flavoring hops I will buy.,['18551']

18578,54829,grainy,"June 22, 2014  2:07pm","when I ordered my 3 nugget hops, they sent me 1 big one( root) and two smaller ones, planted them in may and the big one gave me about 1/3 # the first year. the two small ones did nothing much. hoping the small ones would do better this year but no such luck. so in the end out of 3 plants and 2 years I've got 1 big plant that looks like it will fill up the whole trills that I planed on using all 3 plants for. morale of the story, they do not always send out great plants or at least not all plants are created equal.",['18585']

Possible hop substitution mattered as well. All in all this was a good beer, but the expectations were high so maybe that lead to the slight disappointment. The desire for an immediate next sip did not exist, unlike the original. I should also factor in my changing palet. I think next time I should try a liquid yeast as well. Maybe brew dada stout instead...",[]

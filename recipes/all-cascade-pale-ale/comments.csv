I switched up the hop schedule a bit, went 1oz @ 60 min, 1oz @ 30 min and 2oz @ 10. I plan on using 2oz to dry hop for 7 days then keg. I also used Wyeast 1272 American Ale 2 to keep adding to the citrus flavor of this build. I pulled a 1.054 OG. I will let you know how it turns out in the end.",[]

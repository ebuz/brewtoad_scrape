1st, how did this turn out? sounds like a wonderfully refreshing brew! after years of brewing, i am still trying to nail down the best way to utilize coffee in beer. was it coffee-y enough?
thanks!",['17320']

If I were going to any type of stronger version I would use more cold coffee extract actually but I like this version a lot.,['17334']

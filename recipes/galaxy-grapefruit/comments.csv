There is not much of a head on the beer, but the carbonation is good.  It definitely tastes better with a slight chill or room temperature than cold.
I might add a bit more Carapils to obtain a fuller body and texture next time.  I only added 1/2 an ounce of the grapefruit, therefore I may also add more than an ounce as a dry addition next time.",[]

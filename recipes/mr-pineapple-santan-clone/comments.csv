Its still sitting in secondary with the pineapple and I will keg it when I get back. I will definitely leave an update when I try it. I hope it resembles Mr. Pineapple, thought it was a great beer on tap.",['19035']

Not sure how much more pineapple I would use since it didn't leave any trace of flavor or smell. Overall its a good wheat beer but no pineapple,[]

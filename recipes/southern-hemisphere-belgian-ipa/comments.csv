Not surprised that this yeast didn't really produce any belgian phenolic notes, actually was decently clean, maybe a bit of spice. Nose had lots of fruity/tropical notes with some bits of citrus. The flavor is similar with big fruity notes, the bitterness was quite well balanced, with good hoppy notes on the finish. The consistency was a bit light for an IPA.
I really liked the flavors and aromas of this beer, but I think the palate could use a bit of backbone (though this could be from the lack of body too) and I think I will add some more intense hop notes with the fruitiness. The body should be increased so that it feels more like an IPA than a pale ale.",[]

19954,7858,bpaman1,"November 11, 2014  1:32am",I just found my notes from that recipe. I used 8.8 ounces of coconut that I toasted and racked onto in the secondary. I remember that I was very happy with that beer and felt there was the right amount of coconut. I had it in the secondary for about 4 weeks( I probably just kept putting off kegging it .I can't remember.),[]

17802,52683,springtime,"March 30, 2014  5:56pm",Just brew this. Been in primary for 8 days. Took reading hit FG. Taste was great. I've attempted other dfh90 clones but no luck. The real key in my mind is the Thomas fawcett. That and wpl007. I'll re-post once kegged in a couple of weeks.,[]
17897,52683,springtime,"April 10, 2014 10:58pm","Kegged this after 10 days in primary and 5 in secondary dry hopping. Aroma- DFH 90 all the way. Malty aroma hop back round. There is no question the Thomas Faucett amber malt makes the difference. Taste- same thing there has always been a missing piece to my DFH 90 clone. It is most likely the Thomas Faucett but could also be the WPL 007. Not 100% sure but would recommend using both. Possibly could use a bit higher hop bite, but to be honest that has not been the characteristic of DFH to me at least. This has always had a unique malty quality that I was never able to attain until now. Happy brewing!!!!",[]

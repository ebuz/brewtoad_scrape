19690,59586,TMan03,"October 17, 2014 11:51am","For all-grain brewers, a single infusion mash is all that is required for a porter. For a “rounder,” full-bodied brew, mash between 152 °F (67 °C) and 156 °F (69 °C). Mash out to 168 °F (76 °C) when the mash is done to (mostly) stop enzymatic activity. In addition, there’s absolutely no reason to extend your mash beyond the point in which an iodine test shows that all the starches are converted. For a beer that’s a bit more dry, mash around 148–150 °F (64–66 °C), for about 60 minutes. In a drier beer, the roast character will be accentuated and your porter will have a dry-stout-like element to it. 
A mash thickness of 1.25–1.5 qts./lb. (2.6–3.1 L/kg) will work well no matter what your mash temperature is. In any case, as mentioned above, don’t oversparge. Quit collecting wort at the appropriate time and — if needed, in a lower-gravity beer — add enough water to reach your full, pre-boil volume.

Basically, lots of Huell Melon at flameout.  I've used that hop and it does have a melon note along with grassy and herbal.  
I'm going to make a ginger beer.  I used antwerp with my roasted turkey, but I don't like the product flavors.
Was thinking you could add a small portion of Jarrylo with the melon.    Dad",['25988']

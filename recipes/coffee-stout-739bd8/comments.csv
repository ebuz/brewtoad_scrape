Was keeping it at a steady 68 degrees in the fermentation chamber.  Temp started falling before the settings said to meaning fermentation stopped after about 4-5 days.  Hasn't restarted even after raising temp.  Adding 1tsp nutrient .5 cup sugar in 1 cup boiled water and stirred up sediment.",[]

I'd mashed this at a very consistent 158 degrees so I guess I just created that much unfermentable sugar.  
Cold crashing for a couple days before kegging.  Already tastes a lot like coffee so I'll probably add relatively little actual coffee.",[]

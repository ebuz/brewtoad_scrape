The recipe is very much a work in progress and I didn't get any further that moving it to our ""site"" to do more work on it - as you say I haven't increased the amount of elderflower used. I have not brewed the recipe and there are still modifications to be made to it but rest assured if we do go ahead with any variation I will be happy to acknowledge where I got the idea from. You'll have to forgive me I am very new to this and I did not mean to cause any offence. I understand the responsibility I have to acknowledge the work that you have done and I'll see that I don't make the same mistake again. I hope that satisfies the points that you raise in your review. All the best, David",[]

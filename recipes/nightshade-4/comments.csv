You taste a hint of vegetal flavors, but it's not like drinking tomato juice as the tomato water is only 1 gallon or so of the 5 gallons. The beer aged well. I managed to keep one for over a year and it got quite complex, almost soured.
I plan to brew another batch tomorrow or the next day. Always tweaking the recipe. I liked the addition of sorachi ace hops for aromatics...",[]

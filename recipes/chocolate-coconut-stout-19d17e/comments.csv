21319,40562,Kevin Matawa,"March 18, 2015  3:24pm",I accidentally put in the wrong amounts of Chocolate to recipe builder.  I used 3 oz of a Baker's Chocolate Bar and I chopped it up so it would melt easier during the last 15 mins of the boil.,['21342']
21342,63310,Michael Smihosky,"March 20, 2015  3:07pm",Thank you!  Looking forward to brewing this up in the next week...  Waiting for my Nocturnal Blend to arrive... darn proprietary mix...,['21466']
21466,40562,Kevin Matawa,"March 30, 2015  3:45pm",Let me know how it goes.  I'll be trying the 1 bottle i have set aside this week on 4/1.  The other bottles are for my wedding party favors.,['22126']
22126,63310,Michael Smihosky,"June 05, 2015 11:02am",It was very good but to be honest could have used a bit more coconut flavor.,['22255']
22255,40562,Kevin Matawa,"June 25, 2015  1:21am","I agree..the chocolate can be too overpowering.  What I'm thinking of doing next time I make it, is to use cocoa nibs instead of bakers chocolate.  Maybe that will be a less extreme flavor of chocolate and let the coconut come through.",[]
21483,63310,Michael Smihosky,"March 31, 2015  3:47pm",I definitely will... just got the last of the ingredients yesterday!,['22939']
22939,40562,Kevin Matawa,"November 12, 2015  8:54pm",I'm doing this recipe again this winter.  I'm going to edit the recipe a little and add cocoa nibs instead of the Baker's bar.  I tried this chocolate stout and the bartender told me that use cocoa nibs in the beer.  So hopefully that will get the flavor im looking for.,[]

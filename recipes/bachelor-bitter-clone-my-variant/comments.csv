25467,117,J. Robert Hoppenheimer,"November 11, 2017  9:53pm",This beer turned out really quite well. I did 5 gals each with Imperial A09 (Pub) and A01 (House). The Pub strain finished out a bit drier which I liked better. I might try to tone down the Crystal Malt a bit if I brew it again to get a bit less sweetness.,[]

24833,105828,Christopher Wulff,"March 29, 2017 12:57pm","In the notes section e reads the following:   1 gallon of grapefruit juice and a half gallon of sweetened lemonade right before bottling, increasing the batch to 7.5 gallons, making the ABV about 5.5%. Kill the yeast and stabilize with potassium metabisulfate and potassium sorbate before bottling.
This will be my first all grain.  How will carbonation happen if I've killed the yeast?",[]

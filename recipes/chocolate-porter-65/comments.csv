16609,20002,Josh Van Dyke,"December 20, 2013 11:45pm","Tasted pretty good at bottling. Popped a tester a few days ago and it was carbing nicely. Had a little bit of alcohol taste up front (I think the vodka i soaked the cocoa nibs in settled on the top in my bottling bucket, which would have likely ended up in my tester bottles since I always mark my last 6 I bottle).
Really nice mouth feel and nice chocolate after taste. Will try to be patient and let them sit for a little while before drinking too many!",[]

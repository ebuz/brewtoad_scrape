19939,57990,Babebrewth,"November 09, 2014  4:31pm","The orange extract didn't come through. We added about 5 drops to the bombers before filling, but the Orange flavor completely disappeared. Next time we would add the drops after filling or try a different method - I'm weary of dried peel since they are usually quite bitter. Next attempt might be fresh zest over the extract or dried peel.
The chocolate flavor was very present in the aroma and taste. I would defiantly not go MORE on the chocolate - but it could be dialed back to taste. My buddy and I entered the beer into a chocolate beer competition and it took 3rd place! (we were sure we couldn't overdo it in this case). I absolutely believe using high quality cacao powder at flame out is the ideal way to get chocolate into a beer.",[]

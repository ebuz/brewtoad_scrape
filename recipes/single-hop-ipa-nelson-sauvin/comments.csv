19119,44387,Mike,"August 12, 2014  3:39pm","I have yet to brew this exact recipe.  Though I have brewed an Imperial IPA with a similar grain bill and it turned out nice, but I'd likely reduce the amount of caramel malts and add a little more 2-row; maybe 0.75 lb. of each caramel malt instead of 1 lb. and adjust the 2-row to 11.5 lb.  If you brew it, I'd love to know what you think.",[]

One thing I am going to change for next time is to omit the Carafa III (DE) during the mash and steep it in the wort before boil. Just thought I would give you a heads up. I just opened one of these up the other day. Very interesting. Hope you enjoy it.",['23492']

How did you make the coffee, did you cold-brew concentrate and add that into the secondary. I've been trying to find something like the Ballastpoint cream ale, it is such a great beer and blows my mind. I'll let you know how it goes after I brew.",[]

That decision was the product of experimentation. I did some SMaSH brews I did earlier that year, combining Maris Otter and American hops, and I really liked the combo, so I've stuck with it on many recipes. I prefer my beers to be balanced slightly more malt-forward than what may be typical. Both the Maris Otter and the Munich help get Squeeze right where I wanted it.
I think this spring I'll have to trot this one out again.",[]

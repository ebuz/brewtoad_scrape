Also, what was your starting water volume before adding your LME?
Thanks!",[]

I added a little (probably a total of 1.5 or 2 ounces) of bourbon at bottling for a little extra kick. Nice and smooth with a great oaky, bourbon sweetness that accents the chocolate/vanilla and lingers a bit. 
I started with 3 gallons of water and topped up to 5.5 before pitching my yeast.",[]

25039,40994,Skline,"June 12, 2017  7:31pm","The hops are supposed to be fairly noble, and I think the yeast is just a custom blend of existing saison yeasts, so I actually think it'll taste pretty traditional. The possible exception being the honey and honey malt, but I'm keeping both of those pretty low key.
I want to try a step mash with this one. I know a lot of Belgian brewers are big fans. I don't really understand what the benefits are, but since I can, I might as well try it.
I'm also going to rig something to float the lid over the pot during high krausen in order to mimic an open fermentation. I've seen experiments that have shown that saison yeast will complete fermentation without stalling when allowed to open ferment. 
Apparently they are traditionally fermented open, so it makes sense that the yeasts have adapted to not having the back pressure that the small opening in the airlock causes.
I'm not sure if this blend has that actual problem, but my understanding is that open fermentations do have a pretty profound effect on flavor, and I know that very few American saisons taste even close to Saison DuPont.",[]

I ended up using some WLP611 New Nordic Yeast Blend that showed up first.
It has a nice balance of sweetness and dryness, in spite of finishing at 1.009. There's a subtle apple note on the finish... most likely the result of the New Nordic Yeast blend being isolated from an apple orchard.
Hops aren't really that noticeable... I'm assuming it's that strange flavor that comes about when you mix noble hops and belgian yeast?",[]

I'm pretty pleased. All the apple flavors are gone, and it has some slight yeasty spicy notes, but nothing over the top.
It's way more on target than I expected.",[]

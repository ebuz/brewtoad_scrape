18635,13420,Travis Johnson,"June 27, 2014 12:27pm","I am not sure what happened with the fg.  I was surprised it didn't attenuate more.  Don't know what my exact temps were but i brewed this in November 2012.  My ambient temp in my basement this time of year is about 67 and had it in a swamp cooler with a fan blowing on it so it was probably about 64.  I recall it being OK., not my best but certainly not my worst.",['18638']

20924,49508,raiderrob67,"February 16, 2015  5:28pm",Next time try ramping up the temp after about day 5. bring it up to 68 F for a few a week or more.,[]

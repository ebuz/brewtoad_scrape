Strike grains with 6.13 gal of water at 167.8 째F.
Mash at 155 째F for 60 min.
Mash out with 0.72 gal of water at 212 째F.
Vorlauf and lauter 4.54 gal in your first runnings.
Add 1.46 gal of sparge water at 168 째F.
Vorlauf and lauter 1.46 gal in your second runnings.
Your combined runnings should be 6 gal.

Collect the first gallon of wart and boil this until it becomes a caramelized syrup in the bottom of the brew kettle.  Add on top of this four more gallons of wart for strong scotch ale.  
After setting the strong scotch ale to boil go back to the mash and add two gallons of boiling water to bring mash temp back up to 168-170, stir and allow to rest for 20 more minutes before collecting second round of wart, check gravity and fly sparge until either six gallons are collected or gravity drops below 1.020.  Boil this for an hour with a goal gravity reading of 1.050-1.060 for a second scotch ale.  Be sure to follow the same procedure for the first gallon of the second runnings.  This makes the beer have the caramel notes without the crystal malt.",['17813']

17445,51229,GrahamNash,"February 25, 2014 12:35am",Is your batch size the boil size or the WHOLE batch size?,['17446']
17446,51229,GrahamNash,"February 25, 2014 12:38am","nvm, I just read that you only have/had the ability to brew 2.5g. Let me know if I am wrong though!",['17508']
17508,2254,Brewski09,"March 02, 2014  9:33pm","nope, that's right.  I use a Mr. Beer 2.5gal fermenter.  please refer to or subscribe to http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f12/founders-all-day-ipa-308317/ for a more complete discussion of this recipe and the most updated recipe somewhere in the thread (i will pin it to the 1st page at some point to make it easier to handle).",[]
17452,51229,GrahamNash,"February 25, 2014  4:01am","Another question. For the Citra, did you Dry Hop 1 day after initial fermentation or 2nd fermentation or did you mean with one day before bottling?",['17509']
17509,2254,Brewski09,"March 02, 2014  9:34pm","This is a place holder for me to try Citra hops.  I think they would be fantastic in this beer, but the beer would be changed if you added them and we are trying to make the clone first.  On another dryhopping note, I have taken to dryhopping for 3-5 days to avoid excessive polyphenol extraction.",[]

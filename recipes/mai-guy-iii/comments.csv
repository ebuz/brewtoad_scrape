It seems like it worked but the yeast looks a little strange in the flask.  It's not as floculent as I remember.  My fear would be that it's not yeast and just some sort of solids that precipitated out, but we'll see.  It smells like the rogue yeast anyway.",[]

Approximately 24 hours after brewing I pitched a packet of Mangrove Jack Workhorse.  It did pretty well but only attenuated down to 1.020.  I then pitched a packet of S-05  Either that or the fact that the temperature went up for a few days worked out as it was at 1.011 when I kegged it yesterday.  I put it o 40 psi and shook it around for about 2 or 3 minutes but it was at room tempt.  It's very cloudy. I may hit this with gelatin once it's nice and cold.,[]

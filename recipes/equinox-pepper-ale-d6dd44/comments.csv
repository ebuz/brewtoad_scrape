23362,74476,meneermalik,"February 09, 2016  9:43pm",Brew turned out great. Actually much better than a lot of the pepper beers on the market (around here any ways). I did a 5 gallon batch instead of 10 and it turned out quite well. In 5 gallons I added 3 peppers to the boil and 1 in the fermenter. It's spicy. I wasn't sure it would be spicy enough but decided to brew as the recipe suggested and the amount of burn is perfect. Enough to feel it but not too much where you can only have one beer.,[]

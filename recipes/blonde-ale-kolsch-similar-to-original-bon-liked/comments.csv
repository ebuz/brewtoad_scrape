24743,35672,jclark1031,"March 04, 2017 11:35pm","NOTE, measured about 17.5 gal from parents.  very thin mash, 1.7 plus 6.5 for 8.2 gal first batch, i cut heat at 161, mixed in grains and was at 154ish, added one ladel, stirred, and started mash at 151. 145 and 30 min, 144 at 60 min (maybe it was still dropping from ladel, should have given it a sec), still that great, did iodine test, no starch, lautered 1 ladel, then ran off fast, got 6 (1/2 gal less than i expected), second batch of 6.5 gal at 178, stirred it and left for 8 min at 160, lautered 1 ladel then ran it off and tipped it, got just under 7 (so if i had tipped on the 1st i would likely have gotten 6.5, so perfect 1 gallon per 10 lbs of grain loss), i was just shy of 13 ( it was in the mid 30s so on a warmer day probs have been spot on).  60 min boil, pulled just over 5 in each carboy, the last was some break, chilled one to 66, one to 69, pitched a bit less than 1 pack of s05 in each (1042 OG, 1041 OG called for 7.5, so i may have slightly over pitched).  GOAL OG was 10.5 gal of 1041, ended up with 10.25 gal of 1042, so pretty darn close",[]

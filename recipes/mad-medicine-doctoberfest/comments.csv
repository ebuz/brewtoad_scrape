MAshout 2014 score: 27 (GOOD)... should be way better.  Judges both commented that it was too sweet and hoppy.... needed to have better attenuation and also would have scored better as an Amber ale.  Will adjust the recipe today to get closer to those recommendations.... May also create a Helles recipe today.....",[]

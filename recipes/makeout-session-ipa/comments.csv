17945,2254,Brewski09,"April 16, 2014  8:48pm",Nice.  I've been meaning to play around with Galaxy more.  Do you notice any difference with the New Zealand Cascade (or was that just a quirk of the Brewtoad system)?,['17957']
17957,48754,Sheri_go_round,"April 18, 2014  2:48am","That was a quirk - I used whatever Cascade was at my local homebrew shop, and the % AA indicated on the recipe is drawn from the hops I purchased. For this clone you might want to enter in the alpha acid on the packets that you buy and then adjust your additions accordingly so that you are not over or under IBUs. But with regard to where the hops are grown, in the past I have actually ordered Galaxy straight from Australia, and I think it is a little bit more fruity. It does cost quite a lot to ship from there but at the time I ordered it I did not realize I could get it at my local shop and I got addicted to galaxy while traveling Down Under. Marginal difference in the long run.",[]

I had been making 1 gallon batches for about six months.  Actually did this as a 3 gallon batch, and had to use Ahtanum instead of Amarillo.  Local home brew shop didnt have Amarillo, going to brew again with Amarillo and see how different it comes out.","['18748', '19564']"

I've never tried Ahtanum before - maybe I'll do your variant next time I make this (which may very well be soon because it's just so good in the summer!).
Thanks for your feedback - I hope you are enjoying it!!",[]

I also make my own label for my bottle (beerlabelizer.com) and I found a picture online of the words ""love you long time"" in pink neon, worked out well for my bottles.",['18815']

19001,56894,Homebrewed75,"August 02, 2014  8:12pm","Sheri, I'm brewing this today. I was wondering if you do a primary and secondary with this recipe and how long you let it ferment. 
Thanks",['19049']
19049,48754,Sheri_go_round,"August 04, 2014  6:00pm","Hello! Glad to hear you are trying it out!
When I made it, I let it ferment for 10 days. As I recall, the yeast was churning away pretty vigorously at the start and after about 2-3 days a lot of the action had ceased. That of course depends on your fermentation and conditioning temperatures, but provided you can keep it around 66-67 for the start of fermentation and then let it rise up to around 72F or so for the end of fermentation (say 5 days and 5 days) I think 10 days should be sufficient. 
I did not do a secondary - the American Ale yeasts are pretty flocculant and I felt like it cleared very well. I'd stick with just primary because I doubt secondary would have a great deal of added value and just creates more work.
Then actually I had drinkable beer after only 7 days in the bottle (had to take a sample of course), but it was peak at about 2 weeks in the bottle.",['19121']
19121,56894,Homebrewed75,"August 12, 2014  9:11pm",Thanks for your info in the brew. Just bottled and the smell is spot on for all day ipa. I've got a glass chilling in the fridge right now. Hopefully the taste is spot on too.,['19565']

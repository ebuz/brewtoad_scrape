The point of the honey is to leave only aroma and drop your Final O.G. to bump up the ABV. The combination in this brew of the Raspberry flower aroma and that ""glacier mint"" of the Polaris hops makes this beer very unique. It is one of the best ones I've made and in my opinion, one of the easiest. Its simple and flavorful. Sure to be a hit.",[]

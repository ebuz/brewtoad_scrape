18541,22525,Derek Gillespie,"June 19, 2014  4:58pm",Good to know.  We actually added the pumpkins to the mash on this one and the pumpkin pie spice to the boil.  It was a very simple recipe and I bought the pumpkin pie spice from Trader Joes.  The recipe actually called for nutmeg and cinnamon but the pumpkin pie spice already had those in there so we left them out and doubled the pumpkin pie spice.  This recipe here I want to add an IPA character to it.,['18542']

18889,35640,snowak,"July 22, 2014 10:37pm",changed over the recipe to 1 lb of carastan 30 instead of 1.5 lb crystal 15 since I cannot find any. Thinking about trying to make it a 5 gallon batch to pep it up!,['18902']
18902,35640,snowak,"July 23, 2014  9:19pm","OK, I have tweeked the recipe to 5 Gallons to see how it turns out (I had already bought my ingredients so I couldn't ramp up a 6 Gallon batch)  Hopefully I'll be brewing this in a week and a half and we'll see how it goes.",['22464']
22464,35640,snowak,"July 30, 2015  6:34pm",turned out excellent both the plain and the raspberry were great.  I even put a bottle of each away for 6 months and they were both really tastey.,[]

Really high quality beer.  I've had people who ""don't like IPAs"" drink 3 in a sitting.  It has a very mild bitter after - so it's like an IPA in regards to hoppy character, but not like an IPA with regards to a bitter aftertaste.
Grain bill is pretty much perfect.  Going to reduce the 60minute and 10minute hops to 0.5oz in order to lower the IBU and reduce the bitterness.  Also going to introduce Amarillo and/or Simcoe hops.  Also going to make a batch using only Falconers Flight hops only and another using Galaxy hops only.",[]

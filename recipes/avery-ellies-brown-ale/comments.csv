I've been thinking a lot about the IBU calculator here (and others) that put very little weight on late hop additions -- 0 IBUs even when you practically dump the hops in at flame-out, which is what Avery does.  They must not be using the same IBU calculator.  What do you think?  Did this beer turn out well?  I'm brewing basically this recipe in an 11-gallon batch today.  I'll make a brew log in case you want to check it out later.  The question I keep coming back to is, ""Should I add more hops?",[]

I decided to do a 90 minute boil to compensate for the extra and get a little more canalization of my wort. apparently my boil off rate was not as high as expected so my final post boil volume was about 1/2 a quart more. the OG was 9 point's lower than expected, not sure that is all due to the little bit of extra water or not?",[]

I couldn't find any Mandarina Bavaria (outside of the 1 oz) (my original called for 3 oz Mandarina for dry hopping), and I miscalculated my water addition and ended up with 6 gallons (which is not really an issue as I am going to be transferring a couple of times and will lose some volume on each).  We'll see.  As a frequently traveller to the Chicago area, I make it a point to hit FFF on the way home - Yum Yum has become a favorite and is about the lowest ABV beer FFF carries.  Am looking forward to a couple of iterations on this and, hopefully, coming close.",[]

Very solid fermentation after 12 hours, and blew my lock more than once.  Slowing on day 4 and transferred from my primary bucket to a glass carboy with the 4.5 oz of hops.  Will wait for terminal, crash and move to a keg.  Hope to have this on Thanksgiving.",[]

Purged keg w/CO2 prior to moving over to minimize any oxidation.  Plan is to move to another keg in 7 days and pressurize to about 10psi.,['22969']

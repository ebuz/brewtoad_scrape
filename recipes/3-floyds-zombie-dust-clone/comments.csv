16992,45853,warm_sweater,"January 21, 2014  9:25pm","I think I'm going to brew your recipe this weekend. For the mash time, did your 75-90 minute timeframe include the mashout time? Why was it longer than the typical 60-minute mash?",['16997']
16997,1330,uberg33k,"January 22, 2014  2:55am","Two reasons : the BIAB and the slightly higher than average mash temp.  Truth be told, I think my mash ended up around 155 or even 156.  This is squarely in the alpha amylase only territory.  With only one enzyme doing the heavy lifting and the naturally lower conversion times involved in BIAB, and that's why I suggest a bit longer mash time.  Now, if you're using a 3 vessel system and you can pass a iodine test, by all means, cut it short and get on to boil.  
Mentioning temp here, I'll give a word of advice to all out there who are trying this recipe.  If you like your beer a little more sharp, dry, and a bit of a bite, mash around 148-150.  A friend did that and it comes out a bit closer to the OG ZD.  This recipe ends up a bit more on the sweet side, but it doesn't present itself as sweet.  It honestly plays up the fruit aspects of Citra and everyone who has tried it made this way seems to prefer it.  Good luck and let me know how it turns out for you.","['17017', '17110', '17011']"

17110,45853,warm_sweater,"January 29, 2014  8:38pm","So, I only messed up a little bit! :)
It was my first time taking OG readings from the wort after the mash, and I messed up with my calculations and thought I was going to miss my target gravity. So I threw in some DME. Whoops.
So basically my final OG was 1.090, so it'll be ""The Zombie King"" imperial IPA I guess, haha. Fermentation is going fine several days in. It started to slow a little this morning so I'm going to crack the bucket tonight to take a hydrometer sample and taste it.
Thanks again for your help.",[]
17011,45853,warm_sweater,"January 23, 2014  5:14am","Nice, thanks for the detailed response! This will actually be my first BIAB brew (moving over from extract), so I'm pretty excited. Hopefully I won't screw anything up too badly.",[]
17118,49349,1ceman,"January 30, 2014  2:00am","This is a good recipe. I had to make a few substitutions due to availability where I live. I left out the melanoidin malt and used Nottingham yeast. I was able to reach the target gravity. Now it is bubbling like crazy! Can't wait to dry hop. Did you bottle it or keg? If you bottled, how much priming sugar did you use?",['17123']
17123,1330,uberg33k,"January 30, 2014  5:22pm","I bottle and I use speise to prime.  I use http://www.brewersfriend.com/gyle-and-krausen-priming-calculator/ to calculate how much I'd need.  I basically just drain out all the lines, pump head, and trubby bits in the kettle and you usually have enough just off that.  I might need to pull a bit off the main runnings to make appropriate volume.  I freeze it until it's time to bottle.  I then thaw, strain, and boil for 5 minutes to sanitize it before bottling.  Works well for me and I get to reuse stuff that's normally waste.  If that's not your bag, I'd carb up to 2.2. to 2.4 vol CO2.  I know that's a bit on the lower side for an IPA, but I think too much carb blows off the more delicate aromas from the dry hopping.  Good luck and let me know how it turns out for you!",['17207']
17207,49349,1ceman,"February 05, 2014  2:36pm","I brewed this last week and have dry hopped for five days so far. I checked the gravity today and also went ahead and racked to secondary and did the other 2oz of dry hop. Fermentation went a little crazy and I am at about 8%abv. I tasted a sample and although it tastes good and mellow, its lacking hoppiness. Was it the same for you? I was tempted to add a more aggressive hop, but wanted to stick with all citra.",['17216']
17216,1330,uberg33k,"February 05, 2014 10:26pm","8% is a bit high, but that shouldn't have too much of an effect.  Are you using leaf hop or pellet?  If leaf, I usually put the leaf in a sanitized mesh bag with a few pieces of stainless steel (spare cam locks) to weigh it down.  If you don't do this, the hops would probably just float on top and that would effect the hop character much.  Also, you will find it brightens a bit once you carb it.  If it's mellow, but citrusy, you will notice the citrus punch harder once carbed.  If you find it still not hoppy enough after the second charge, see if you can get some pellet hops and allow that 3-4 days.  That should get you the utilization you need.",[]
17367,42303,redd,"February 17, 2014  7:08pm","Has anyone substituted WLP002 with Safale S-04?  I am going to brew this over the weekend for a friends party in April, and was wondering if the substitution would change the flavor.  I have 4 packs of Safale S-04 on hand.",['17379']
17379,1330,uberg33k,"February 18, 2014  5:14pm","You won't get the fruity accent that WLP-002/Wyeast1968 gives.  It will also end drier with S-04.  It's not a substitution I would make, but if you want your beer a little more dry and a bit more bitter hop punch as opposed to fruit-floral hop character, then go for it.  The only yeast substitution that might be interesting is finding some Conan/Yeast Bay Vermont Ale yeast.",['17410']

http://freshbeereveryfriday.blogspot.com/2014/06/angel-boots-zombie-dust-inspired-beer.html
I live near Three Floyds and rumor has it they finish this with Amarillo.  I went with 2 oz Citra/4 oz Amarillo in the dry hop for 10 days.  It works.  Used London yeast because I had good luck with that in the past.  Turned out to be a great beer.",['20278']

Also, used Wyeast London Ale III 1318 instead of the white labs. Turned out better than Zombie Dust in my opinion.",[]
22238,66881,Bruce Kish,"June 22, 2015 12:34pm","I'm using your grain bill as a base for a pineapple-habanero ale recipe I'm currently preparing.  I'm thinking of adding 0.5 lb honey malt to provide a bit of residual sweetness to counter the pepper heat and pineapple acidity.  The hops schedule will include Warrior for bittering with Citra and Falconer's Flight for aromatic.  Additions will include 0.5 gal of pineapple puree for the last 15 minutes of the boil and two sliced habaneros for 10.  During secondary fermentation, a quart of pineapple juice will be added, along with Citra dry hopping, and another pepper.  The objective is a beer that starts sweet, picks up a bit of hops, and finishes with a little heat.",[]
24034,92917,nitro1439,"August 09, 2016  4:36pm",Scaled this down to a 2.5 gal batch and it was the best IPA I've brewed to date. The late addition hops and DH really make the nose pop - which is something my other hoppy beers lacked. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!,[]

26131,71349,spookify,"July 16, 2018  3:02pm",Brewing Temps ran very high as compared to these targets. First 20 Minutes we were around 159/160 and let if free fall to 150/140 the rest of the way. Grain Bill was stuck in a clump so Temp was giving in inaccurate reading. Still had a very solid OG.,[]

26189,71349,spookify,"August 08, 2018  9:28pm",Notes: Coriander Seed is pretty strong after 1.5 weeks of Carbonation. Will make future notes as it ages. Adding Lactose to the Blackberry Gose covers up a little bit of the tartness and Coriander. It's pretty darn amazing! Salt amount is perfect as of right now. Cherry Gose takes like tart apple pie with a large Coriander after flavor.,['26242']

Blackberry Gose w/Lactose the flavor faded heavily after 2 weeks of kegging and drinking. Lactose mellowed out the fruit and the fruit thickness also went away after 2 weeks.",[]

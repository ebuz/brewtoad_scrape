16583,44369,Phillydawg,"December 18, 2013  6:29am","BTW..this is my 1st recipe.  I'm not sure why Lactose is calculated as fermentable?  I'm sure I did something wrong.  It's calculated in the FG, but obviously it won't ferment.  This one should be right around 1.030, with an ABV around 5%...not even CLOSE to 6.8%",[]

Boiling for 1 hour and 15 minutes on the clock but in practice it was probably a bit longer than that.  Set aside reserve boiling water to keep the level up as I want to keep the color low.  Probably the smoothest brew session I've had in a while.  Chilled it down and topped off with around 1.25 gallons of cold spring water and sprinkled the yeast on without hydrating or aerating.  Wort was at around 61-63F when I pitched.  I'll let it free rise.  Room temp is around 72F so that should be ideal but I'll keep an eye on it.  Some concern about color.  It looks a little darker than I'd prefer.  Before adding the DME late I dissolved it some water that had cooled from boiling and then added that to the wort at 15 min.s but I don't think that would have darkened it much.  We'll see.",[]

More clove/spicy than banana.  Banana was more on the nose.  Overall flavor is cleaner than I'd like.  Not bad, though.  Still, this needs to sit.  Gonna let it ride for another week in the primary.  If this doesn't make the grade, it's probably the dry WB-06 yeast.  I'll probably just stick to the Wyeast Weihenstephan yeast from now on as that seems to yield the best results.",[]

A calculator I looked at suggested 10 oz. but that seemed on the high side.  I can always adjust when it's on the gas.  Didn't taste it but it smelled ok and the color was good after all .  I suspect the earlier percieved darker color was just yeast in suspension.  I did make a point to make sure and drag some yeast up from the bottom during transfer.  It's at around 71 F sitting in the dining room so I'll just leave it there for a three weeks or so and then check it.,[]

22154,9037,Jmat,"June 09, 2015  9:47pm",6/9/15 - This just kicked.  It was good.  This recipe is about right but as I said earlier it's too clean.  Next time I'll use the wyeast and ferment on the higher side.,[]

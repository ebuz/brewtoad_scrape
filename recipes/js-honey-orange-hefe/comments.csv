Brewtoad showed no change in srm but the final product came out a staunch redish orange. The taste is identical to the malted white wheat though. I will use malted white wheat from now on. This is a very fast fermenting beer. All 3 times it was completely done in 5 days and ready for bottles, and gets drank about as fast. 3rd time brew had an OG of 1.040, and a FG of 1.008 again. The 2nd brew was a flop because I got distracted and let it boil for over 90 minutes with hops added, aroma was all wrong, almost no haze or mouthfeel, and acquired a skunky profile.",[]

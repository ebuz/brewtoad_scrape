4/28/17 - Light Fruit aroma and flavor with earthy finish. Slight bitter bite at back of tongue after finish. After several sips it's annoying - Might be the Wheat fighting the Chinook Late Addition.
5/3/17 - After all - the fruit came out at the start and ended with a Chinook bite finish. Not the best.

Initial taste tells me it is young still and needs to mello out a little bit. The wife says it smells a little bit like soy sauce, she thought the same about the wort. But, as a dark beer lover, this came out really well. It was brewed for a party a couple weeks ahead, I think it should reach it's prime about then. Cheers!",[]

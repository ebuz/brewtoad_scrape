        <NOTES>Originated from mass selection of the Cluster hop, which is an old American cultivar. It is suggested that they arose from hybridization of varieties, imported by Dutch and English settlers and indigenous male hops. There is an early ripening and a late ripening Cluster cultivar. Also known as Golden Cluster. They can give a black currant aroma/flavor. Substitutes: Brewer's Gold.</NOTES>

Gives the distinct citrus/grapefruit aroma to the Pale Ale produced by California's Sierra Nevada Brewing Company, the best-selling American pale ale in the country. One of the "Three Cs" along with Centennial and Columbus. Named for the Cascade Range. Substitutes: Centennial and Columbus (but they have a higher Alpha Acid content).</NOTES>

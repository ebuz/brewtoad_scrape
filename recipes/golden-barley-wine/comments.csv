I've read or have been told that in late 19th century England grain bills for strong ales were very often comprised of just base malt and a single bittering charge of whatever hop the brewer had at the time. I have a difficult time sensing the 'bready' characteristic in Marris Otter that supposedly sets is apart from standard American 2 row. So, for the sake of saving a few dollars I'm going to forgo the MO and opt for American 2 row.",[]

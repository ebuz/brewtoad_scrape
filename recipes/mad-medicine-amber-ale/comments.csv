1/9/14 Batch review:
This batch wasn't bad, but could use work.  More bitter than I desired. The cedar was too powerful, would definitely cut back on that...it was interesting though, and has been fading with time.  Spec Grav was high...still trying to trouble should that...could be misreading the instrument, or yeast issue.  Will work to try and figure this out. Color is perfect,",[]

I see this as a failure.  Would not add the cedar to this beer again, at least not in the same amount (25 blocks).  The taste was described as rough, dry, and harsh.  Judges were very tough on base recipe...basically no balance and not much flavor.  It think this is hard to judge because the cedar was overpowering on my palate.  WE will make recipe adjustments to get back to a nice Base recipe.

Too bitter right now, but it seems to be improving with the cold conditioning.  Tastes pretty good, but not thrilled with the galaxy/el dorado combination.  Not bad, just not that interesting.  I think I need to wait and see how this is in a week or two before passing judgment.",[]

I felt it was a little dry and this was probably due to the yeast which is supposed to be a beast.  If I did this again, I would up the crystal to compensate.  The only real gripe is the hop flavors.  I don't know that the el dorado was even detectable and I guess I'm just not that into galaxy.  It definitely has a ""citra without the cat piss"" thing going on but I'm just not that into it.  I am however in the minority here as everyone else who tried it loved it.",[]

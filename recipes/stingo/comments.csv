16708,12486,Marty,"December 31, 2013 12:07am","It's a blend of an English strain and Brettanomyces. It definitely gives some very interesting esters. Young, it's fruity and as it ages the Brett starts to dominate. I did an Old Ale with it in August that is really coming into it own now.",['16746']
16746,6092,Ken Nelson,"January 02, 2014 10:15pm","I won a gold in a club competition once with an old ale. It actually WAS an old ale, I had brewed it a year before for the club Simcoe hop special (any beer style could be used, but the only hop you could use was Simcoe). After a year, all the ""bold piney aromas and flavors of the Simcoe were gone, and all that was left was the bitterness to balance the high gravity malt backbone of the original beer (imperial IPA). It had lots of aged sherry notes, and an overall ""old"" profile. Talking to one of the judges afterward, it was a very close candidate for Best of Show.",[]

The colour was a nice dark red and the wort tested good. Boil was good an vigorous for 1 hour, hop additions as in schedule. cooler added 10 before the end and took about 10 to drop the temp down to 20. ended up with about 20 liters so topped it up to make for 1.048 and 22 liters. pitched the yeast day after to make sure the wort was at the right temp.",[]

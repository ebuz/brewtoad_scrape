19724,45495,Brendan Anthony,"October 20, 2014  6:59pm",I didn't hit the gravity listed as I opted to get some extra beer (about 2 gallons) out of this Bohemith.  I even sparged a second time to get an additional 5 gallons to make a light beer.  I added about a half gallon of fresh juiced cherries and a lb of brown sugar to make a cherry syrup to up the gravity of this wart.  I pitched some WLP545 on top of this because its the only yeast I had available.  Looking forward to how these turn out. :),[]

21651,54798,Tad,"April 14, 2015  8:29pm","I recall it being decent, but if I were to brew it again I would use DME instead of LME. DME is more expensive, but the final product is considerably better - particularly with regard to taste. I also recommend adding extract at both 60 minutes and 15 minutes left in the boil. Adding all the extract at the beginning of the boil screws with the color and flavor. The last IPA I brewed I added 3lb of light DME at 60 min and 4.25lbs at 15 min. The result was worth every extra cent I put into it.",['21702']

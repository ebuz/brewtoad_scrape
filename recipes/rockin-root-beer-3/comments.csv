It looks like this is your 4th attempt to perfect your Root Beer recipe.  How is it?  Would you care to throw out any tips, or tricks?  I've made one root beer recipe that turned out OK and I think the next time i will look into juicing the ABV but didn't want to sacrifice taste to accomplish this.  Any help you can give would be greatly appreciated.",[]

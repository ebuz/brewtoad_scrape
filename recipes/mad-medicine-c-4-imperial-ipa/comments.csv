First time using Extract...probably won't do it again....Changing the mash and sparge moving forward to improve efficiency.  Would like to stir and realign the grain bed 3-4 times during both processes.  We did not hit the initial OG we were looking for, came out at 1.077.  Also, the fermentation took off very fast and was vigorous, however, the yeast quit early.  It stopped around 1.041...After more additions of yeast and yeast nutrient it finished around 1.035.  We should be able to get this drier though.  I will continue to read/research about BIG beers.  We did Mash for 75 mins between 150-152F.  No additional Acid was needed in this mash.",[]

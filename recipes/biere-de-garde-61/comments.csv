19307,54126,smallbottle,"August 29, 2014  2:39pm",Kegged this in the spring and we are just approaching fall.  It has been lagering this entire time and I just pulled one of the keg and absolutely love this beer. Malty sweetness but still finishing dry and slightly musty. The beer has cleared really nicely as well.  It's a welcomed beer at the start of fall.,[]

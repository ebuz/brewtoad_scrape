Thanks.","['21808', '21847']"

You don't get any flavor from 60 min additions in my experience. I'd do exactly what I did. An oz at 10 min, a 1oz 15 min hopstand @ 180F after the boil, and a 1 oz dryhop, then bitter with whatever you want to get to the desired IBU.
If you're familiar with neomexicanus hops, they have a distinct ""weedy"" character to them. To me, it smells like reefer smoke. Latir is not quite as strong with this as the Chama variety.
So, with my hop schedule above, I got a nice blast of herbal, sticky and dank with mild citrus fruit right away. Over time, the dankness has faded, and some more spicy qualities have come out, almost reminding me of noble varieties, but more fruity. At the moment, it is quite spicy and earthy. Still a lot of fruit (after 1 month in the keg).
If you like these hop, definitely get some Chama next year.
Good luck!",[]

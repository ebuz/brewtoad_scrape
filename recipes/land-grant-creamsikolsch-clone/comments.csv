Flavor isn't quite how I remember it. The orange didn't come through as much as I thought it might (may add orange zest to secondary as well as boil the next time I make this) and the vanilla just barely makes itself known. It almost tastes more like a Hefeweizen, with fruity flavors that may be off-flavors.
Overall it's not bad, needs an adjustment or two.",[]

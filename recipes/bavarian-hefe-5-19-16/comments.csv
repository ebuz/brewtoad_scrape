23757,12690,rockmodestly,"May 21, 2016 12:15pm","Hit 1.051 with the OG - fell a little short in volume. Lost some on three separate occasions with the hot break - need to watch that like an eagle next time, for the first 15 minutes.
Pitched both starters which had, by that point, fallen way past high krausen. My hope is this will stress the yeast and produce nice banana-y off flavors. For now, they are bubbling away at ~ 68-70 ambient, a little low, but that's what the basement is at this point.",[]

Strong sulfur-y smell from fermentation, but there is an underlying banana-ness that is very pleasant.",[]
23767,12690,rockmodestly,"May 23, 2016  2:10pm",Just calculated 70% efficiency based on the 1.051 OG. Not surprising given how I lost some during the hot break.,[]

It's at least 4 generations used. I don't think it actually contains Brett, as WLP670 does, it doesn't have any Brett character or behavior. Attenuation is very high, though, much closer to 85% if allowed to ferment in the 80 to 85F range for maximum ester punch.",['22057']
22057,62167,Sera Wohldmann,"May 26, 2015  2:55pm","Update: Turns out it actually is 670 and while it did originally contain Brettanomyces, it may not have much impact due to long refrigeration times and the use of a starter, both of which favor Saccharomyces and may dwindle the Brett population or kill it. However, it may, so monitor gravity carefully - if given enough time, it could drop this recipe FG below 1.005 and be prepared to bulk age before bottling to avoid gushers or bombs.",[]

        <NOTES>American aroma-type variety bred in 1974 and released in September 1990 by S.T. Kenny and C.E. Zimmermann, the breeders of this variety. Similar to Cascade and Chinook. The genetic composition is 3/4 Brewers Gold, 3/32 Fuggle, 1/6 East kent Golding, 1/32 Bavarian and 1/16 Unknown. One of the "Three Cs" along with Cascade and Columbus. Centennial is often referred to as a 'Super Cascade', since it has a strong citrus aroma.</NOTES>

        <NOTES>This hops origins stem from an early US breeding program circa 1956 and was the first commercially bred hop to emerge from the USDA-ARS program when released in 1972. It was bred from crossing an English Fuggle with a male selection believed to have been a crossing of Fuggle with the Russian variety Serebrianka.</NOTES>

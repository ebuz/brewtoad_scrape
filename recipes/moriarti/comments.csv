Flavor is similarly as complex with light graininess and creamy, smooth dry finish. The unsweet chocolate notes linger through the dry finish.  This is very easy drinking and seems best when carbonated on the low side.  Head starts out large, thick and dark brown and slowly diminishes to a thin, dense, dark brown head that remains through the pint.  Lacing present.",[]

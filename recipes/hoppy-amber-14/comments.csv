Couple of suggestions around hitting numbers:
 - Do you usually get 75% efficiency with your setup? I get quite a coarse crush on my pasta machine and I avoid sparging too heavily, for a 1.060 beer I would prob set my brewhouse efficiency to 60% in beersmith, that also includes losses in the kettle due to hops etc - but that's just my system/process.
 - Have you got an accurate way of measuring the volume in your kettle? (Can't even begin to calculate efficiency without this, I marked out a stick). One thing I only figured out recently is that I marked out the stick with cold water, so it's out by a couple of litres during the boil as liquid expands when hot, doh :p.
 - Depends on what you want, but when brewing hoppy beers be prepared to lose some litres in the boil and in the fermenter after the dry hop.
 - I've given up on trusting the hydrometer temp conversion calculators, especially at extreme temperatures. I bought myself a hydro sample jar (great investment) that can handle 100 deg temps, then chuck this in a bucket of water and take a reading after like 20min or so. You could use any other container to cool down the sample though. Make sure you still check the temp of the sample when reading and adjust (e.g. if it's still around 30 deg C I'd still use the conversion calc). 
 - Even after doing all this I was still under shooting my OG so now I try to hit a pre boil gravity that's a couple of points above what beersmith tells me, this has been getting me good results (I'm happy if I'm within 2-3 points of my target).
My current approach boils down to being very conservative about the efficiency of my system, means I use a little bit more grain but don't have any problems hitting a high OG.
For this batch I would ferment it out and taste it, if it tastes thin and you've got access to maltodextrine powder, chuck 100g or so of that in (boil in a little bit of water to sanitise). Might come out great though, good luck :)",['16649']

 I actually don't know what my efficiency % is. I've not had problems hitting OG in the past, but this is only the second brew that I've crushed my own grain for (first one was low too, so I went finer on the crush this time). 
Actually I just tried adjusting the efficiency down to 60% and that gives me a predicted OG of 1.048, which is a bit closer.
I didn't sparge at all today, just lifted the bag out. I'll have to sort out a stick / measuring system for kettle volume.

I've got a plastic sample jar, I risked it with the 77 deg wort today, seemed to handle it ok. But yeah, good call on cooling the sample prior to measuring. 
Anyway, thanks for the info. Hopefully measuring my kettle volumes and being a lot more conservative on the efficiency estimates will help things",['16650']
16650,28018,oliverdrake,"December 27, 2013  7:11am","Sweet bro sounds like a solid plan, if dropping it to 60% only gives 1.048 that probably means you need a decent chunk more base malt in your recipe. On my system I'd probably use upwards of 6kg base malt to get 23L of 1.060 beer. If you got the recipe off someone else you can just adjust the base malt amount up or down for your efficiency, leaving the specialty malt amounts as they are. You only need to increase specialty malt amounts if you get really bad extraction (in my pasta maker mill I've taken to crushing the specialty malts separately on a finer setting as I wasn't getting the colour/flavour I expected).

Couple *POTENTIAL* things to try that haven't been mentioned. 
1) Your mash temp seems slightly high, as you are mashing at full volume the grains don't have that much effect on your strike temp. You probably used a calculator and hit what you aimed for but for small volume BIAB I aim for 68C after mash in (strike temp varies depending on ratio but I tend to aim around 3.8-4 ratio and ~72. If it's under 68C it's easy to step it up with a bit of stirred in boiling water from a jug. I find 68C at 25L mash water holds temp well if insulated, it tends to stabilise about 66-67C for the majority of the mash. So you aim slightly high to get a 'drop through' effect. 
2) I think a 'mini sparge' would help, but keep it small for ease of use. There will still be a lot of sugars trapped in the grain bag, so I usually sparge around about the same amount of sparge water as grain weight, with about a 4/1 liquor to grist strike ratio. This means that you only get the richest ‘second runnings’ in the sparge, rinsing out the most concentrated sugar in the bag. So in your recipe I’d drop the strike to around 26-27L, then you only have to boil a couple of jugs and use a kitchen pot to hold the 5L 75-78C sparge water. A pour over bag sparge rinse with an oven tray to hold the pegged/bungie cord closed bag is better than nothing, and it doesn’t take much extra time or effort vs a full volume BIAB. As your volume/gravities increase you can do larger sparges and longer boils to keep strike water volume down to fit the kettle size, the sparged wort can be added slowly up to 15mins to the end of the boil
3) Upscale your recipes to a litre or two above what you are aiming for, especially with hoppy beers. Even if you nail your gravity/efficiency predictions you’re going to lose 1-3 Litres to trub in the kettle (and another 1-2L from yeast and evaporation in the fermenter). So I have taken to aiming a litre or so higher using brewtoad to account for this. You may hit 1.060 at 19L, but not be able to access the last litre due to kettle trub. So upscale the recipe a litre = 19L useable at 1.060. 
Here's an example I brewed yesterday - aimed for 65% eff 1.055 @ 24L, got 60% eff 1.053 @ 23L - needed a couple L extra sparge water.",['16694']

17739,31980,Fuxorfly,"March 23, 2014 10:11pm","Brad - It was woody and phenolic, which my fiancee enjoyed (she is into barleywines). Not nearly as sweet as I was going for - I was trying to capture the flavor of an extremely caramel flavored beer I had a year ago. It didn't turn out anything like that. Granted, it was also one of my first all grain brews, so I assume a lot of how it turned out was due to methodology, and not because of the recipe.
If I was to do it again, I would probably add a lot more caramel 40 and add caramel 20, as well as completely redo the hop bill - simcoe was what I had on hand, but I would probably switch to CTZ for bittering and avoid a late hop addition altogether.",[]

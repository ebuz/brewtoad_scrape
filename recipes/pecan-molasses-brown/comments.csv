I'm planning on substituting the Molasses with Steens (it's similar), and possibly adding some sugar I have that is similar to Brown Sugar.  You mentioned in your review that it needed more body.  Do you have any recommendations?",['23294']

Hope it ended up well when you brewed your version, I would like to know how it went.  I very rarely re-brew beers just because I enjoy the challenge and variety of always brewing different stuff, but if I do I think next time for more body I might add some dextrin malt or maybe some oatmeal.",[]

22652,57912,Jordan,"August 30, 2015  5:15pm","5/1/2015: Weizenbock bottled. Began souring a few months ago (accidental, but we rolled with it). Will sit in a bottle for a while to blend.
7/1/15: taste test 2- better than previously. Still a bit too oaky from those oak chips, and the sour punch that comes in the nose is weak in the taste. Improving but needs time.
8/15/15: much better! begging to really sour up now. Less woody, more tart and clean. A bit of a pungent after taste that I'm guessing is from the oak chips will hopefully vanish in a few more months.",[]

1) is there a reason you have the 2-Row Malt listed twice in different amounts.
2) What is your recommended steeping temperature?
Thanks!",['17160']

I hate to say it, but I'm guessing some intel was lost in transmission. The 1.5 Lb of 2-row was likely a Maris Otter or a Golden Promise. As for mash, I like my lawnmower beers dry. I prob went low and slow with this one. I'd say 150 F for at least an hour. Good luck!",[]

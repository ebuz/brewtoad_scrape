16776,48532,Merlin Ward,"January 05, 2014 12:54am",Brewing this for the second time. It's a family favorite!,['17431']
17431,46350,SEATTLEBREWING,"February 23, 2014 10:12pm","Would you tweak anything on the next one? I was thinking a 1813 London III yeast for this, thoughts?",['17530']
17530,48532,Merlin Ward,"March 04, 2014  4:22am",This brew is already pretty sweet. It would be interesting to see what the 1813 does with it. I was actually thinking increasing the second hop addition to 1.5 oz to tone it down.,['17532']
17532,46350,SEATTLEBREWING,"March 04, 2014  2:38pm","Probably the M Otter, and the scale looks to be as you say, it also looks light.  You might also adjust the time of the addition. Did you come up with this one on your own?",['17536']
17536,48532,Merlin Ward,"March 05, 2014  1:37am","Its a variation on @JohnLapolla's. You're right, it is lighter than traditional style. Have handed this one out to quite a few people and everyone enjoys it. I probably won't change anything on it. However, I am experimenting with the fruitier hops for a few IPAs (IPA Test Vx in my recipes). All around 40-50 IBU, which may also be sweeter. Doing 1 gal tests this weekend.",['18520']
18520,46350,SEATTLEBREWING,"June 17, 2014 12:43am","Merlin, After much research the yeast seems to be the issue here with all that Otter.  WLP 007 would be a much better start or Mangove Jack's 07 which is probably the same.  I'll be trying this one and adding a tad of Special B.",[]

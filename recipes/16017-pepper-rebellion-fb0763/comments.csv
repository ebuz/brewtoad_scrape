Thanks

I dont crush or mill at all. It is the flavor from the husk that I want and not the spicy character from the white inside part of the pepper. So when you crush or mill the pepper the beer will get a spicy aftertaste which is not so nice in such a dry beer. All the flavor is in the black outer layer.

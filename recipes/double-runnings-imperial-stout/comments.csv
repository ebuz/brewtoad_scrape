22408,1643,Michael,"July 19, 2015  3:39am","Mashed in with 7 gallons of 170 degree water into a cold (room temp) mash tun.  After grain addition it was a 150 degree mash and had a one gallon mash out using boiling water.  Vorlaufed and lautered 6 gallons of wart that was boiled for 90 minutes to yield an initial gravity of 1.093 at room temperature.  After one week in primary the gravity has decreased to 1.042.  The belgian ale yeast is a yeast cake from the triple I made several weeks ago and just racked into secondary, and the WLP007 was added to a 1000mL starter a day before brewing. 
The second runnings ended up as a 1.040 brown porter using one oz each of fuggles at 60 minutes, and E Kent at 30 and 15 minutes.  The second runnings were racked onto the yeast cake of the IPA I made with the triple several weeks ago.  I also racked the IPA into secondary.",['22545']

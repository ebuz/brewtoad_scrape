24510,62289,Wilby,"December 29, 2016 11:30pm","To brew this sour blonde with apricot, mash at high temp for a short amount of time: 160°F (71°C) for 15 minutes. The idea is to create a wort with low fermentability and even some starch remaining. Boil 60 minutes.
Ferment with primary strain at 68°F (20°C) for ale or 62°F (17°C) for lager.
After primary fermentation is complete, rack to your aging vessel of choice (shoot for as low oxygen permeability as possible to limit acetic acid) and add Brett/bacteria blend.",[]

The hops might be too bitter and dank at the beginning of the taste but they end up pretty crisp.  Next time I might nix the Columbus and try Amarillo or Simcoe with the same hop schedule.  Might also take out a half pound of malt or more to lower the abv. The beer I'd consider this closest to is the Phoenix Pale Ale by SlyFox.  All told, for the $19.50 I spent making a 3.5 gallon batch, this is awesome!",[]

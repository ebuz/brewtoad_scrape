Brewing process:
1. Bring the heat up to 160 (slowly) and kill the heat at 160 and let steep for 10 min.
2. Pull the grains and let it drain 
3. Add all the DME (Brewcraft instructions call for adding half at this point but I am doing all of the DME in a full boil)
4. Bring wort to a boil 
5. Add hops and 2oz of the Heater Tips after the hot break
6. Boil for 60 mins 
7. Add 1.5 Lb of honey (half of the jar provided) at the 45 min mark of the 60 min boil
8. Add wort chiller to start sanitation process (this will need to boil for 15 min)
9. Add the remaining 2 oz of Heater tips for the last 10 mins of the boil
10. Pull Heater Tips and hops at the 60 min mark and kill the flame.
11. Start wort chiller and bring the heat down to at least 80 degrees
12. Transfer to fermenter and pitch yeast",[]

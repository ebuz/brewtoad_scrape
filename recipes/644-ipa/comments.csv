25455,72082,Stovetop Brewers,"November 08, 2017  4:42pm","I was happy that it came across as both a Brett beer and an IPA in the different categories.  I also liked that the 28A asks if it's 100% Brett fermented -- and that's a clear no!  The leftover yeast character from not finishing out made it much more ""funky.""  Haven't remade it since, but definitely on the list.",[]

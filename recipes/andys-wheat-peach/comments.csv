If I were to tweak it, I would go 65 - 75% Wheat, with 35 - 25% 6-ROW-- reason being: the wheat is really light and refreshing & pairs well with fruits, but the 6-row replacement would make up for the 2-row's lack of boldness and body, while giving the wheat the spotlight.  All in all, looks really good and I think we should brew it.",[]

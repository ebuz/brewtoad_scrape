*Candi syrup added with 15 minutes left in boil. Use the dark amber recipe in this thread: http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f12/20-lb-sugar-jar-yeast-nutrient-114837/, but only make a half batch (use one pound of sugar). Add the entire batch to the boil. This stuff is super easy to make and imperative to the recipe. The syrup it makes has a smooth decadent caramel flavor that is deeply rich and complex. The flavor and aroma make it through to the final beer and blend with the malt and hops to make a spectacular beer.",[]

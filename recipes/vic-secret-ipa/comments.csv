Actually, I didn't add any hops until flameout. I used what's called a ""hopstand"", which is where you add most (or all) of your hops at the very end of the boil (ie. 0 mins).
This gives you excellent aroma and flavour, of course, BUT it also adds some IBUs, even though the wort is no longer boiling.
It's hard to estimate how much bitterness you get from hopstand additions because it depends on how slowly the wort cools down and how much you stir it, but I've done it a few times and I've found that a 30min hopstand adds about the same bitterness as 10-15min boil, and a 15min hopstand adds about the same as a 5-10min boil.
Because I used a high-alpha hop and added quite a lot, I got plenty of IBUs just from those additions.
Hope that makes sense.",[]

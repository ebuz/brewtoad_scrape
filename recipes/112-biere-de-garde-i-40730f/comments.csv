A very, very mild beer. Not especially aromatic, although there are faint suggestions of a yeast-driven sort. Phenols or esters, IDK. It ended up overcarbonating just a tad, but not a gusher, and once poured and warmed, it's quite nice. Retains the head exceedingly well in this serving mode. This brings to mind licorice, but there's a vague tartness to it that I attribute to the East Coast Ale Yeast. There's also a slight, warming booziness as well which I don't prefer. 
Next time: less Munich, and add Vienna. Up the Special B a tad bit more, and use a different yeast. Try to get more maltiness into it.",[]

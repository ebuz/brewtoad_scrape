20695,61602,Huffmatic,"January 25, 2015 10:22pm",It turned out really nice.  This is a very nice recipe.  Remind me never to fill my boil kettle w/ water from a hose:)  But the yeast is a very active one so make sure you have a blow off hose.  Otherwise it was fantastic.,['21506']

2) You can rig up a whole house charcoal filter to the hose.  It's a relatively cheap project.  Search Beer Geek Nation Easy Water Filter on YouTube: https://youtu.be/Dtx_WBAflUw",[]

20927,12379,Triplehorn,"February 16, 2015  9:22pm","Mike, this is the first of our many commercial brews done back in 2012.  We scaled it up to a 10bbl batch, and the extract was fantastic.  We have now gone to real fruit puree, and it takes the syrupy flavor away, for a better tart fruit flavor.  In doing so, we have also added copious amounts of sweet orange peel for a stronger nose.  
Play around with it.  I promise you'll enjoy it!  Try lowering the IBU's to around 15 in order to showcase the fruit.",['21017']

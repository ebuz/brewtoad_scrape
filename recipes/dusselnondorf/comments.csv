16911,35713,phishak,"January 15, 2014  7:32am","Brewed a 4.8 gal batch, as I mistakenly bought 6 lbs of Pils instead of 7.
Pitched at 68, cooled down to 60-62 that night. Kept at 60 degrees for the primary fermentation; good, robust start less than 12 hours after pitching. 3 days later, and things have slowed down, it looks like the yeast is dropping out of suspension a bit. I will raise the temperature after 6 days to 68 for a diacetyl rest overnight, bottle, and cold condition in the garage for at least 2 weeks.",['16957']

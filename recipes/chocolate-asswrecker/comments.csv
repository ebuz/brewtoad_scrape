25776,125288,Troy Cleveland,"February 22, 2018 10:42pm",Can you please explain the process you used with the sativa hash and the everclear?  Was is like you would do in adding wood chips?  Did you soak the buds in the everclear then pout the whole thing in?  Did you use dry or still wet buds?  My email is troycleveland@gmail.com if you would rather email than use this forum.,[]

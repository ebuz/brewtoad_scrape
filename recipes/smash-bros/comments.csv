Much like the first all grain beer I made, the scottish, mash temp ranged from 140-170 during the hour long mash. I need to get an actual mash tun. The BIB method works great if you have a large enough bag, but trying to mash with multiple filled grain bags is near impossible. We stirred frequently, but not frequently enough. Fermentation was very fast and within 2 days all activity in the fermenter had stopped. I forgot to take OG so I have no idea how far off of the recipe I was. Zythos hops smell AMAZING. I dry hopped for the last week by just throwing the hops into the fermenter. After the second week I moved the beer to the keg and added some table sugar (amount was from a chart I found 1/2 cup maybe?) dissolved in hot water. I figured keg conditioning might give it a little bit of a better flavor than force carbing it. I have never done this before though. If it carbonates in the keg I'll know in another week or two how it tastes.",[]

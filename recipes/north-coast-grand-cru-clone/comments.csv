21763,54257,Steven Park,"April 26, 2015  4:42pm","Brewed this and have aged in a bourbon whiskey barrel, and it turned out beautiful. ABV is too high for my taste (well, for anyone's taste i believe), but this is a genuinely good beer for a special occasion. 
I would definitely drop caramunich2 and a bit less of agave nectar and corn sugar (maybe half).",[]

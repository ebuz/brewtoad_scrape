After a preliminary taste that was disappointing at best we came close to tossing it down the drain. Fortunately, Pip had the presence of mind to keep it bottled so we could judge the carbonation to see if our calculation for the priming was good. Well, thanks to Pip for that decision as now almost a year later we're tasting an awesome vanilla mocha stout. A keeper for sure.",[]

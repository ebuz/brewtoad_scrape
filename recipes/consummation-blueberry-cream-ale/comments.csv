18819,12334,Drew,"July 15, 2014  2:02am",Very interested in how this is progressing. A nearby 'you pick' farm here in southern Ohio is in-season for blueberries. We picked 16 lbs. last weekend. I'm going back for more for this recipe next weekend. My thought is to make a puree and put it in at about 7 days in to the secondary. How long are letting it go in the secondary?,[]

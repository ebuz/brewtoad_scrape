22642,57912,Jordan,"August 29, 2015  4:35pm","08/28/2015 - finally emptied the collaboration brew. 10 gallons imperial stout, 10 gallons chocolate stout, 5 gallons cherry stout all in a used red wine barrel for 8 months. 
Smell: amazing. slightly tart, fruity, definitely medium oaky
Taste: stout holds it own...much less sour than anticipated, with some tart fruit (almost like the after taste of a pinot)",[]

Very nice tart cherry on the sides of the mouth, and the mouthfeel is great...not too thick and sweet, but not watery. Added ~ 4oz priming since it has been sitting for a while",[]

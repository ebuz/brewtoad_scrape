20446,3646,Eric Cooper,"January 02, 2015 12:33am","I got to cook with gas burner today!  It made a world of difference as I was able to get the vigorous boil that had eluded me in the last 3 attempts.  
OG was 1.060 (target was 1.065) so i got much closer on that.  
I think i will try to use a secondary fermenter since i forgot to drop a whirfloc tab into the boil.  Will update when i do that.",[]

I am also formulating a sorachi lemon saison with oyster shells and peppercorns but am not quite sure if I should only add the lemons just before flameout or let them boil in there for a bit. I don't want it to become overwhelming.,['18820']
18820,36961,trappistpunk,"July 15, 2014  3:58am","I brewed this a while back, and if I rember correctly, I never actually added the lemon peel in secondary. I used the entire zest of one large lemon at 5 min before flame out.  
Between that and the Sorachi Ace dry hop, I think it was perfect without the secondary addition. If I wanted more lemon, now I would probably just add more zest at flame out and do a 5-10 min steeping rest before chilling. 
If you're going to add peppercorns, I'd suggest no more than 1 oz by weight, coarsely crushed, to start. That will get overwhelming much faster than the lemon, but I have used it to success. I also find that peppercorns need at least a couple weeks in secondary to loose their bite. 
Anyway, I loved this beer and was just thinking that I need to brew it again. I'm going to update the recipe to remove the lemon peel from secondary. Hope that helps!",['18837']

I've read a few other recipes that also added it at 5 minutes, and I think I might do 5 minutes and then 5 minutes steeping rest before chilling. Adding in a hop bag so I can just yank them out. A recipe from Brooklyn Brew Shop's ""Beer Making Book"" has a Lobster Saison with white peppercorns. They suggest 2 TABLESPOONS of white peppercorns added at 30 minutes, which sounds kind of insane to me! Going by what you mentioned regarding losing the bite if adding in secondary, I think I'm going to add the peppercorns (maybe just 1 tablespoon) during my 15 minute hop addition in a bag and then take them out for fermentation. I will not be dry-hopping this recipe with Sorachi, just doing a single hop with 2oz total at standard intervals. But hey - ya never know! Maybe I will dry hop it! :-)",[]

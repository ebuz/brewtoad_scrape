All my extract versions are too dark.  I suspect it's just something you can't avoid when using extract with wheat as I don't really have that problem with other light extracts.,[]

It ended up being really good.  The strange kind of grainy flavor went away and the hops mellowed.  Probably my best hefeweizen to date.  Gonna try this again and maybe use liquid yeast.,[]

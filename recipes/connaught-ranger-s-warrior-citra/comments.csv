It could be because it's a single hop (other than bittering), it may benefit from a variety of dry hops. I'd also simply double the amount next time. The Belgian candi syrup gave it some hot alcohol notes - that kind of give you a headache more than it should. I would consider skipping that addition next time as well.",[]

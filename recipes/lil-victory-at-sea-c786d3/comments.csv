Overall a nice beer
Next time: use less alcohol in tincture for vanilla beans and leave beans and cacao in keg at bottom until keg is finished
4oz of coffee concentrate seemed good initially (3 days in keg) but faded to mostly vanilla (cacao blends well with roasty malts - good) and vanilla now overpowers a bit and the vodka from tincture is noticeable
warming significantly improves balance and flavor though head tends to diminish. aroma is amazing upon fresh pour.
shaking keg prior to pouring helps",[]

Isolated from a uniquely crafted double IPA out of the Northeastern United States, this yeast produces a balanced fruity ester profile of peaches and light citrus that complements any aggressively hopped beer. Expect this strain to take off fast and ferment wort quickly, though elevating the temperature following the bulk of fermentation may be required to raise the attenuation.
In order to achieve high attenuation, we recommend fermenting at 67-69 ºF for 3-4 days, and then raising the temperature to 72 ºF until a stable gravity is reached. We also recommend mashing at 148-149 ºF and adding a small percentage of the fermentables (~ 5-10%) as sugar.
Attenuation has also been reported to increase when repitching after the first generation.",['23859']

Very clean, crisp flavor characteristics with low fruitiness and mild ester production. A very versatile yeast for styles that desire dominant malt and hop character. This strain makes a wonderful “House” strain. Mild citrus notes develop with cooler 60-66°F (15-19ºC) fermentations. Normally requires filtration for bright beers.",[]

Expect this strain to take off fast and ferment wort quickly, though elevating the temperature following the bulk of fermentation may be required to raise the attenuation.

24047,71349,spookify,"August 14, 2016  9:33pm","Great color, Not Sweet at all, Medium Maltyness and a prolonged ending bitterness. Great head retention. Hoppyness is Medium Low and sort of lost in the bitterness. Sterling is mellow and it needed more or a lot more cascade dry hopping. This is a dank bitter beer but yet very smooth. If Cascade was added to the dry hop it could have balanced the hop and bitter dankness. However if you want a high bitter dank beer that is slightly piney then this is the beer for you. The base grains are very well balanced and possible a stronger hop and dry hopping would really make this beer shine. Overall this beer is a 8/10 for me and we will be submitting it to one BJCP comp next month. Side Note: This is probably the best beer we have brewed! Zero off flavors and very complex.

If anything there is slight astringent but this could also be the lactic acid we used. Amazing Head retention! Little Dark. Wish we would have entered this one haha!

24233,71349,spookify,"October 05, 2016  2:58pm","Aroma
1) (7/12) Light bready malt, piney hops and orange esters on first whiff, no off aromas
2) (9/12) Slightly dank background, piney aromas are there, malty sweet background
Appearance
1) (3/3) Clear dark gold, fine bubbled head with good retention
2) (2/3) Slight off-white head, some bubbling with fair retention
Flavor
1) (10/20) Not a very high hop flavor as expected, more piney should be prominent.  Large malt background.  No lingering hop bitterness, but slightly sweet finish with some grassyness
2) (10/20) Light bready malt, low citrus, high resiny hops, medium bitterness.  No phenols, lingering malt finish
Mouthfeel
1) (3/5) Medium body, good carbonation, no astringency.  Some alcohol warmth
2) (2/5) heavy body feel, good carbonation, lingering malt
Overall
1) (8/10) Solid east coast style IPA, very drinkable, perhaps a bit more hop aroma could help lighten the malt balance
2) (6/10) Nice beer, malt is a little overwhelming background to the hop character.  More citrusy hops could bring out some complexity",[]

19705,3646,Eric Cooper,"October 19, 2014  2:25am","my brother's calculator also said that the color would be a 23, where this one calculates it at a 15.  weird...",[]
19703,3646,Eric Cooper,"October 19, 2014  2:12am",i don't understand how the OG on this site's calculator came up with 1.015.  the BrewMe calculator on my brother's iphone said this would be OG = 1.085 and would come in at 8.4% ABV.,[]
19704,3646,Eric Cooper,"October 19, 2014  2:19am","Ok, changed it from 'extract' to 'all grain' recipe and viola!  everything is good...",[]
19776,3646,Eric Cooper,"October 25, 2014  7:57pm","A fortuitous (lucky) accident happened at the brewstore while filling my grain bill.  The owner allowed me to weigh out the amounts as he tended to other customers, and my brother was helping locate the grains.  When i told him 1.5 lbs of Crystal 20, he heard ""120"" and i didn't catch the mistake until the grain was mixed.  so i dropped the roasted barley and carared, which amounted to only .65 lbs. of the bill and my color came much closer to what i had in mind!  so it improved the color, and the reduction in grain only affected the OG slightly.  I am stoked!",[]

19929,3646,Eric Cooper,"November 08, 2014 10:05pm","On election day i found out that (after 72 hours of no activity) the original yeast i pitched, California Ale WLP001, began to ferment.  So i created the starter of the BRY-97 American West Coast for nothing.  darn it.",[]
19999,3646,Eric Cooper,"November 16, 2014 12:27pm","after one week in the fermenter, i added 1lb of honey to increase fermentation.  i also added 1oz of Cascade hops for dryhopping.  
today, 11/16/14, i will bottle.  
when i removed the hop sock, there was a second layer of krausen on top of the beer!  adding the honey did increase the fermentation!  woo hoo.",[]

21177,3646,Eric Cooper,"March 08, 2015  8:11pm","i had high hopes for this, but i fu**ed up and carbed it WAY too damn high.  i have to pour one 12 oz. beer into a quart (at least) container to accomodate the head, then transfer it to a glass after 5-10 minutes.  holy crap.  i still believe in the recipe, so i will try it again.  it happened due to my mixing priming sugars (1/2 cup of DME, and 1/4 cup table sugar.)  won't make that mistake again.  1 priming agent only next time and from here on out.",[]

21176,5959,rosch32,"March 08, 2015  8:10pm",Are these fresh peaches that you have peeled and sliced then froze?  Do you do anything to your peaches before adding to the secondary?,[]
21180,16753,JF_HBrews,"March 08, 2015 10:26pm","yes, they were fresh. I blanched them in boiling water for 30-60 seconds to make peeling them easy. Then I sliced, bagged and froze them. Purchased frozen fruit is fine too. I didn't do ant more to the peaches, just added them to the fermenter. Some people will dice or puree the fruit but I haven't noticed much difference when i tried it.",[]

I am pretty new to brewing like an earlier commenter and this will be my first fruit beer.  Would you mind sending more complete instructions (to uzda1@verizon.net)?  Thanks!",[]

Also, coriander at 0.0 minutes, does that mean it only goes in the fermenter?",['17870']
17870,47789,Wronn,"April 07, 2014  5:49pm","Dane, the ""5.0 each"" just means the zest from 5 lemons.  The ""0.0 minutes"" for the coriander means that it goes into the boil pot at flame out.  I recommend using cheese cloth or a grain bag for the zest and the seeds, so that they can be easily removed.
This beer had some harsh flavors for about a month after bottling, but after 3 months it mellowed into something quite good.",[]

It's a great beer. He thinks it's the best one we've done in a long time. I haven't had Old Rasputin recently and I'm not a very good brewer and our system is wildly inefficient, so I don't know how it compares, but it's a great stout regardless. Our shop only had CaraMunich, so we substituted that. My OG was 1.073 and my FG was 1.027, so 6% abv. Poorly executed, and, if I had to guess, nothing like Old Rasputin. I don't care. It's great and has been very popular with the crew. The keg is going to kick in the next day or two and I'm doing another batch this weekend. Thanks for the recipe.",[]

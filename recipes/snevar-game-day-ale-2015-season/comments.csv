The recipe changes wildly each season and 2015 is no different. I've been unsuccessful at figuring out a way to end up with a purple-hued beer, at least not without relying heavily on food coloring or a lot of dark fruit. In using blueberries this season, my hope is that most of the flavor and aroma will ferment out, leaving behind a fairly hoppy purple-ish beer. Might be a little ambitious but that's what makes brewing beer fun, right? A few notes...
• Add 1 oz. Palisade hops at flameout.
• Puree frozen blueberries before adding to Primary. You could probably use canned blueberry puree but in my experience, frozen fruit works just as well (sometimes better) and it's much cheaper. If you find your blender is having a hard time, throw in some sanitized water to help it along.
• Dry hop with remaining 1 oz. Palisade hops during last 7 days of Primary, as opposed to transferring to Secondary. Dry hopping in Secondary is fine too, I've just personally been skipping it all together and going straight to Cold Crash after an extended Primary.",[]

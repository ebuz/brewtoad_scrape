22904,38547,Jeff Dailey,"November 05, 2015  5:53pm","The founder said that the one piece of advice he gave the brewer, when he hired him, was, ""spend as much on hops as you need to. price is no object."" So I went for it.",[]

22990,71241,Casey Hart,"November 25, 2015  2:29am","So, this is a guess?",['23010']
23010,38547,Jeff Dailey,"November 30, 2015  9:55pm",Yep. But it largely falls in line with other clone recipes and the information that TG has made publicly available.,['23011']
23011,71241,Casey Hart,"December 02, 2015  6:47pm","I'm on a quest to clone psuedo by the end of next year so bear with me, just bought a pound of citra (don't want to do that too often $$!) After drinking more than my fair share of it, I was thinking of going with a hopburst approach with no bittering charge but you have 2 oz FW, also why 007 vs 001 or 1272?",['23023']
23023,38547,Jeff Dailey,"December 05, 2015  3:27pm",I really just went through the HBT thread and reviewed a lot of the recipes. http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=443295 Most of them seem to agree on 1968/007 as a yeast and FWH.,[]
25802,104482,Mike's Basement Brewery,"March 02, 2018  5:39pm","Search for my ""Dead Philistine"" recipe. It's pretty close to Sue. I only used 8 oz of citra (whirlpool and dry hopping). Use ground flaked oats to get the haziness and some wheat. That will bump your FG as well since Sue's FG is 1.016. I'll probably jump up to 12 ounces of Citra on my next batch, though.",[]

17008,48555,Steve,"January 23, 2014  1:24am","So I brewed this with a couple adjustments ""see the variant for the recipe"". Turned out great! SWMBO loves it. I'm more of a IPA type of guy but I have to tell you I will keep this on tap all summer long. It's a easy drinking thirst quencher lawn mower type of beer. Add some lime and salt and it's hard to tell the difference from Corona. I plan on serving this at a Irish fest my home brew club is serving at. Would like to hear some feedback on this if you try it out. Cheers.",[]

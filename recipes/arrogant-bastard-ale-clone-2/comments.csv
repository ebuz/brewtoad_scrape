If I were to change anything, I might up the initial bittering for another 10 IBU's, and double the flameout/whirlpool addition.  Cheers!",['19888']

The only thing I would change is to add either a small addition ( .250-300 gr) of carapils , wheat malt, or torrified wheat to get the head retention up a bit to match the original beer. Otherwise, bang on ! Looks awesome, wish I could taste some. Will be looking forward to brewing this one myself, thanks !",['19057']

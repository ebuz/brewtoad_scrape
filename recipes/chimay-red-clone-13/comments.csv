17318,9037,Jmat,"February 13, 2014  2:54am",Brewed on or around 2/1/14.  O.G. was around 1.075.  Plan was to ramp up from 66 to 75 over 4 or 5 days.  Shot up to 70 in half a day though.  Ramped from there to 75 over a few days.  Sitting at around 62 deg F now.  Gravity is 1.010.  Target is 1.008.  I'll let it sit for a few more days at that temp then put it in the back room at about 50 deg.  I'll keg it when the current keg kicks.,[]

I'll put it in a keg when I get around to cleaning one, as I am probably just going to let this one sit for awhile.  It had improved when I racked it.  Color is spot on.  Seemed to be lacking in esters, but it could've just been the yeast in suspension.",[]

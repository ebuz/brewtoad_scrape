Let me know when it's done, I'd like to try it.

16518,6092,Ken Nelson,"December 12, 2013  1:20pm","Funny? Funny looking, maybe :) 
But yes, I do expect it to be very hoppy, and with a low residual malt backbone to stand up to the hops. I've had a commercial beer like that, I disremember the name, but it was basically ""hop tea"", no body, no malt, just hop flavor.
For a good example of a balanced beer with lotsa hops, try Sierra Nevada Torpedo, which is one of my favorites. Good body, strong malt backbone, and lots of Cascade flavor & aroma.",['16528']

To me it provides a nice sweetness without getting in the way of the star of the beer, the hops. See a recipe I did about a year ago called Frivolous. The people that drink my beers will tell you it is one of my best beers.",['16530']
16530,6092,Ken Nelson,"December 13, 2013  7:43pm","Marty, is this a lower attenuation yeast? If that's the case, I can see it leaving some residual unfermented sugars to balance the hop loading. I think the beer I had was Hopunion, or Hopunious, it was by a small local brewer, and had a really low FG, so it was like miller lite body and taste, with a massive hop loading.",['16534']
16534,12486,Marty,"December 14, 2013  1:11pm","It should end up finishing around 1.012. I pulled a sample last night when I dry hopped and this beer is tasting good so far. Full of grapefruit, citrus and dank weed hop flavors. There is a little sweetness from the honey malt. I can't wait to get it bottled up. I believe you are referring to Hoponius Union by Jack's Abby. I find that to be an extremely drinkable beer. If you don't like that, I have a feeling you won't dig this beer either.",[]

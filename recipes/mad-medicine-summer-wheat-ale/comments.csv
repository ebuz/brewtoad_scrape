17236,15628,Matthew Beatty,"February 07, 2014  5:50pm","2/7/14 Mashout scores:  29 (Good to Very Good).... Not bad here....Judges believed this should have been placed in a Fruit beer category and would have scored better on style...we will remember this.    More carbonation needed.  Sparge could have been too acidic....gave judges a puckering sensation.  Not bad though.  WE were not going to a traditional Hefeweizen...I am not a huge fan, this is an American wheat easy drinker....it may not ever score well in a category, but still could be an excellent beer.  We will plan to make some subtle changes to the recipe today.",[]

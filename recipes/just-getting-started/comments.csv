21943,49508,raiderrob67,"May 13, 2015  4:11am",Not very good. the addition of the apricot's and the lower than expected final volume made this almost a 6% ABV beer. it is very alcoholic. I will let it age for about 3 month's and see how it is.,[]
22024,49508,raiderrob67,"May 21, 2015  1:44am","UPDATE: Just cracked one open tonight and it is REALLY good. very clear, clean and crisp. carbonation was good and had a long lasting fluffy white head. taste was good a little malt, balanced bitterness hop's was very light a hint of fruitiness probably from the apricot. just goes to show.......if you don't like one of your beer's, let it age for another 2 week's it will change.",[]

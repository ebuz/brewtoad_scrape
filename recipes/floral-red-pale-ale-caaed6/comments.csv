No Citra hops left so had no choice but to swap it with Chinook which is like Citra in that is has similar Alpha acid properties and a good oil content so dual use.
Massively dropped the roasted barley and upped the Cara Red grain.  
Kept the Base Malt as the Maris Otter Ale Malt.  This has lowered the SRM to 9 so it should be quite pale.  Looking at the brew perhaps this is a underestimate.",[]

23246,9037,Jmat,"January 16, 2016  2:34am",Brewed this last week.  Went along fine at around 65.  It did get a bit cold for a while but it looks ok.  On 1/15/16 gravity is 1.010 so it's likely done.  Krausen has not fallen yet though.  Sample tasted green and yeasty but good.  I will let it sit a while longer to see if it drops and to let it condition some.,[]

Next time I think I need to leave it on the yeast a little longer.  I think I kegged after only 9 or 10 days so longer in primary next time.,[]

21963,65276,antjdavenport,"May 15, 2015  3:44pm",Used Dry Nottingham. Because of a mistake in calculation ended up with slightly less than 5 gallons in the fermenter. Probably around 4.6 gallons. Original gravy was 1.042. Fermented in a swamp cooler for a temperature of around 59-61F. Final gravity after 11 days was 1.006 for a ABV of 4.7%. Tasted fantastic in the hydrometer. Light and refreshing with a slight fruity finish although perhaps a slightly slick mouthfeel which may indicate some diacetyl which is odd given the low fermenting temperature. I will give it a while longer on the yeast cake to clean up and then bottle. So far very promising however.,[]

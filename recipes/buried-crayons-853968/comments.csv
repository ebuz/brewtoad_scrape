Also the Farm/Grassy/Earth Notes of the Saison were not present and the ultra smooth taste/feeling of yeast 3711 was left. This beer is also very strong and the tartness helps cover that up making a smooth ultra light beer. Will report back after carbonation.,[]

Few Tweaks next time including less cranberry's and possible something to cut the tartness and or add color without taking away the smoothness.",[]

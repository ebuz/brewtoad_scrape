18283,49508,raiderrob67,"May 28, 2014 11:12pm",FG is 1.002. a bit lower than predicted but that was probably because of the 90 minute mash time.,['18311']
18311,54829,grainy,"May 30, 2014  4:49pm",I have never herd of adding alpha enzyme to the mash but that could of been part of the low FG.,['18312']
18312,49508,raiderrob67,"May 30, 2014  5:03pm",I added them because of the thin mash. I wanted to make sure I got the highest amount of monosaccharide's I could. I wanted this beer dry and it is. the long/low scarification rest probably would have been enough?,"['18313', '18650']"

18650,38504,Rysk Brewing Co.,"June 28, 2014  4:52am","If you actually held 148 it probably shouldn't have been THAT dry, but if it coasted down to 140-144 for a good time, indeed it's possible.  It's also possible if the bag was loose, that the enzymes required for breaking down those sugars into smaller chained non-fermentables were denatured (which can happen in long thin mashes).  
The interesting thing about biab is that depending on how tightly you hang your grain you can have an overly thick, or overly thin mash.  I've only done a single BIAB session before I moved to a MT, and I certainly prefer the tun.  If you can, it's a worthwhile DIY cooler project, but if you really do like the BIAB idea, then it might be worth doing some research on how to control mash thickness.",['18651']
18651,49508,raiderrob67,"June 28, 2014  5:10am","Yea I think I held it pretty close to 148F. it is actually not over dry, just right I think. it works well with the nice floral/fruity juiciness of the centennial hops. I left the bag lose in the pot and left room in the bag so it should not have been overly thick.
As for the mash tun I really don't want to deal with a manifold, vorloft's or a stuck sparge. I have been mashing inside the cooler in 5 gallon paint strainer bags. they are cheap. I only put about 4-5lbs of grain per bag so they are easy to lift out and put in the strainer for sparging. worked real good on my last 2 brew's.",['18652']
18652,38504,Rysk Brewing Co.,"June 28, 2014  7:37am","Fair enough.  I've not had a stuck sparge yet.  3 or 4 cups of rice hulls in the mash, and my steel braid hasn't choked up yet.  As for vorlaughing - well, it does get a nice clear running and it doesn't take much effort.  Certainly minimizes the first hot break. Just picked up my 10 gallon kettle, so will be doing a full boil batch this holiday weekend, so I'll see how it goes.  Hopefully whirlpooling 5 gallons will work better than doing it with 3 as I've always done.  If all goes well i'll get the pot drilled out and the valve added too.  Nice to be able to transfer direct from mash to boil without messing around with intermediate containers.",[]

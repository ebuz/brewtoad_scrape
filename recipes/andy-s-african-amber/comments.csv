25835,22034,rednender,"March 17, 2018  4:27pm",I have not brewed this beer yet.  Mac n' Jacks is one of my favorite beers from WA and I can't get it in PA.  I've looked at a lot of other recipes and and notes from people on forums who supposedly worked at Mac n' Jacks.  Supposedly Crystal malts make up a large portion of the grain bill and there is no organ peel.  This is a work in progress.,[]

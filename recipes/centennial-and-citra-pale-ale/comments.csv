I hit similar numbers but only did a 60 mash and came a little short on volume so I did a 75 minute boil. I love how adaptable this brew is if you need to make changes on the fly. I got 1.055 with just under 6 gallons and I'm using Imperial Organics House strain @ 68, first brew using Imperial. Thinking about dry hopping, leaning towards Amarillo. I'll let you know how it turns out. Thanks for the inspiration.",['24948']

Cheers!",['24962']

Really great flavor, very clean with just a bit of esters. Reminds me of some classic favorites. I transferred to secondary today and hit it with 2oz of mosaic I had lying around. I'll crash temp at the end of the week and keg it up the following week. Cheers!",[]

Done two versions and have tried incorporating the cilantro at two different times,  and neither one of them brought out the cilantro like I was hoping for, virtually nothing. My mother in law absolutely loves it though.  May try to make like a cilantro tea and add it into secondary to incorporate some flavor and aroma, but nothing too much. Suggestions?",['18655']

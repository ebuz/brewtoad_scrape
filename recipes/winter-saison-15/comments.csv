16284,12932,Rob Kyle,"November 23, 2013  6:04pm","Mashed with 3gal water at 162C to give 147C.  After stirring mash at 15min, temp dropped to 143C.  Maintained temp of about 145C for remainder of mash (90 min total).  Was going to batch sparge with about 5gal more water, but the runoff from MLT was too slow.  So instead I did and improvised fly sparge with about 4gal.  Grain bed fluctuated between 150C and 198C over the course of a 90 min sparge.  Inconsistency is my middle name.",[]

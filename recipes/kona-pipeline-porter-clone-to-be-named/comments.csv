OG was between 1.058-1.060 and I was drinking Sierra Nevada Celebration's while brewing. im gonna call it Halema'uma'u Coffee Porter (my last name is Hale and I've shipped 100% kona coffee from Hawaii just for this beer!)",[]

I think that the quality of the coffee makes all the difference. I used 100% kona straight from the farm, cold steeped 1/2 lb for 3 days in 32oz water. French pressed the grinds before sending them through a coffee filter and realized the amount I extracted was a bit low so I added more water to the original grinds but, looking back, I would probably just start with 48-64oz and be happy. Cold steeping keeps you from extracting unwanted tannins from the coffee.
All in all I love the beer and my wife has already requested that I brew another batch of it so she doesn't run out. 
Ps I would love to hear some recommendations for an IPA recipe (maybe even a double).",[]

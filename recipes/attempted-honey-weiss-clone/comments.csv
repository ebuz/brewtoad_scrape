I ended up dry hopping it because the yeast I used and likely the temp I fermented at (68-75ish) were not ideal.  After it sat about 10 days on Citra hops and then aged 6+ months in bottles, it was almost drinkable if it was ice cold, though.
It was my first attempt at designing my own beer though, and I learned a lot from it!",[]

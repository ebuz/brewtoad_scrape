24288,15648,Matt,"October 18, 2016  5:12pm","batch split, between czech lager yeast and steam lager yeast, temps fluxed daily from 55-65 most temps held at 62-64F. The czech yeast started out ok and then got very sulfury and had a little bit of a unpleasant character (with  the exception of one day of smelling very good and lager like) both gravity ended at 1.008. On the OG 0.5lbs of sugar had to be used to make up for a lost gravity issue. The steam smelled with light sulfur before finishing out, it ended very malty smelling with only a small hint of sulfur. The yeast dropped out and was crystal clear at 7 days. It stayed in the bucket until day 10. Taste out of the bucket was very good. It was mashed at 148F with a 90min boil",[]

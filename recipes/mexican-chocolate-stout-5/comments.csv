24670,101998,Ty,"February 17, 2017  7:21pm","So I brewed this last month and kegged it last Sunday. i did not get the OG or FG on the recipe ( I got 1.082OG, and 1.030 FG), but this was my first recipe i brewed. I tried it last night and i was pleasantly surprised, a lot of the cinnamon and vanilla notes are not there yet, but i hope in about a month they will start to show up (I did not add the Chili powder though). Overall i like it a lot 7/10!",[]

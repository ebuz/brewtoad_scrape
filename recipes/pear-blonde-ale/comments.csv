Keep in mind pear is a pretty subtle flavor, so if you drop the concentration too low, it will dissappear. I think if you wanted it to be more beer like, instead of reducing the pear, I would instead up the grain bill. Also keep in mind the volume the pears will bring when you make your beer base. For example if you want 5 gallons of finished beer,  you'll need to make like 3.5 gallons of the base beer, but calculating grain bill based on the full 5 gallons.
As a rough estimate of the volume from the pears, I would say assume they have the same density as water to change from weight to volume. Then assume about 75% of that volume turns into the beer rather than pulp.
Also the pears will break down to a difficult paste that you will need to manually strain through a fine mesh your first racking. Subsequent rackings I would do like normal. You might try some finings in the second or third racking to help separate it all. Or a lengthy secondary should help it all settle to a more firm pack on the bottom.
Forced filtration would be an alternative option if you have that equipment already.

If you're in the bay area, I have a few bottled left if you want to try it.",[]

It was good while young, but I think the high proportion of pears meant it was somewhat more like a pear wine in terms of ageability. I'm going to make another batch pretty soon, keeping this high percentage of pears.
I also made another pear beer a few weeks ago, which is about 9%, a dark ale, and only about 15% of the fermentables from the pears. That is fermenting with a lager yeast, so it will be a bit of time before I find out how that turned out.",[]

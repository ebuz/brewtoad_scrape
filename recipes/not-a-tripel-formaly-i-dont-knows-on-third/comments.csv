17439,6900,Ben,"February 24, 2014  5:56pm","Sadly this has come out too dark, (It is a lovely color but outside what a Tripel should look like) and it is too heavy as far as mouthfeel goes.  Making this again, I would omit the Caramel Malt entirely and maybe lessen the grain bill just a tad to lighten up the body a bit.  
The flavor of this beer is excellent, with a nice hop aroma and taste, but I need to re-work this recipe to make this a Tripel.  As far as barleywines go?  Well it isn't too bad!",[]

I think using cocoa powder instead of nibs in the boil and maybe maris otter instead of 2-row for the base would get me where I want to go. The body was great and it was sweet without being like drinking dessert. That being said, the chocolate was REALLY subtle. I probably could have gotten a similar flavor from just grain without springing for the nibs.",[]

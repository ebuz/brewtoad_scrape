25386,43933,kharding,"October 18, 2017  1:43pm","Actually, you should add 3 Tbsp of spice and pumpkin with 5 minutes left in the boil.  
I've been toying with the idea of not including the pumpkin filling at all.  I feel the flavor comes from the spice and not much from the pumpkin. It always leaves a lot of sludge in the carboy. If you feel like you do want to add it, I suggest roasting the pumpkin at 350 during the boil and put it in a hop sock.  That should help contain the sludge.

25286,124697,Robert Davis,"September 18, 2017 12:11am","9/17/2017: Batch was bottled on 9/3/2017.  Allowed nearly two weeks for carbonation, bottles were rock-hard after 12 days.  Chilled a test bottle for 48  hours, cracked open today.  Nice hop aroma with the very faint lemongrass influence, will increase the lemongrass next time to 2 to 3 ounces.  Not overly strong, easy drinking porter.  Light mouthfeel, carbonation moderate.  Little head retention, but I've never been one to fuss too much over my beer's appearance.  The recipe is definitely a keeper.",[]

21421,64612,Psamathos,"March 27, 2015  3:36am","Brewed this last week, pitched 1 vial of WLP575 directly into the wort which caused a 2 day lag time but it fermented well. It stayed around 19°C for the first few days, but I ended up putting the fermenter in a water bath and bringing it up to 20°C to protect it against temperature spikes since we let the thermostat drop at night. F.G. is around 1.010. Smells great, very similar to Hoegaarden,  although it tastes somewhat more bitter than I expected given that I only boiled the bittering hops for 45 minutes but this may be from the krausen. If the F.G. is stable I should be bottling this weekend.",[]

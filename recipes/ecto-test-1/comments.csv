Added a little blue food coloring which made it greenish, though that faded a bit.  Pulled a sample and it's decent, if neutral.  Gravity is 1.010.  Not really any sour going on right now which is fine.  Kind of earthy.  No real hops or bitterness are perceivable.  Added a litltle bit of orange tangerine juicy juice and some blue food coloring to the sample and it was a nice murky green.  Tasted pretty good actually.  Need to figure out how to condition this.  Either use the juicy juice and bottle condition, or maybe just cold crash then force (over) carb in a keg and then bottle that.",[]

Instead of the usual priming sugar I added 48 oz. of Orange Tangerine Juicy Juice.  Adjusted color with a few drops of blue and yellow food coloring.  Didn't need much coloring.  Color is a nice bright green.  Orange tangerine flavor came through on sample.  A bit of earthiness which is not bad but may not be desirable at the end.   That could be hops bitterness, or just hops, but there's no real typical hop bitterness or hop flavor to the sample.  No idea how this is going to carb.  The idea is for this to have the citrusy flavor but not too sweet and balanced by some beeriness.  It will be quite light given the juice addition.  Juicy juice lists apple, pear and grape juice concentrate as the first three ingredients so hopefully the yeast can convert that to CO2.  I'll let this sit for 3 weeks and see how it goes.",[]

I'm going to have to watch these closely or they are going to explode.  I'll semi pop the caps so pressure doesn't build and then I'm gonna have to guestimate it to get it to carb.  alternately I guess I could try to heat pasteurize them.  Putting the bottle into a secure box with a plastic bag around it now.",[]

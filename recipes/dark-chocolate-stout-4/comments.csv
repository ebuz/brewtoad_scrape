20287,1383,chaswood,"December 15, 2014 12:48pm","Brewed December 14, 2014 on the back deck.  Cloudy, calm with the temp about 55 degrees. Nice full rolling boil, with a couple of small boilovers. Initially used 3 lbs. of DME, but wort was a bit too dry, so added another.  OG was 1.061, a bit lower than calculated.",[]

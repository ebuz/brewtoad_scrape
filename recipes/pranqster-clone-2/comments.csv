10% Wheat Malt
15% sugar (by grist weight) - double what is the the recipe above
1.070 OG
17 IBU

We use two separate yeast strains, one fruity, banana and the other one clovey, bubble-gummy. The beer is unfiltered so there will be some yeast in the bottom of the bottle, however, you’ll want to get a fresh one, less than 3 months old. Check the packaging date on the bottle, lower right side of the label. If it’s not there, you have an old bottle.

Good luck,",[]

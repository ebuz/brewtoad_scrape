After 1 hour, heat to 170°F (77°C) and keep it there for 5 minutes (mash-out)
In a separate pot, heat 0.9 Gal (3.5L) of water to 170°F (77°C) and sparge as per these instructions
Right after sparging, add 0.15oz (4g) Citra hops, this is called “First Wort Hop”
Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a rolling boil and let boil for 60 minutes with no lid
15 minutes before end of boil, add 0.25oz (7g) Citra hops
Do the same 10, 5 and 1 minute before end of boil
At the end of the boil, cool wort as fast as possible down to yeast pitching temperature 70°F (21°C)
Sanitize your fermenter by shaking sanitizer in it, transfer the wort to it, pitch 1/4 pack of Safale S-04 dry yeast (= 3 grams) without bothering about rehydrating the yeast, shake well for 5 minutes for oxygenation, place a sanitized stopper and blow-off tube and let ferment for 8 days at 66°F (19°C) in a dark place
After 8 days, carefully remove the stopper and add another 0.6oz (17g) of Citra hops (this is called Dry hopping and it adds a lot of hoppy flavor to your beer), close the fermenter back again and let ferment for 6 more days
Bottle beer with minimal oxygenation
You will need 1oz (28g) of honey for priming (more info about refermenting beer in bottles)
Let condition in bottles for 2 weeks (preferably 3)
Refrigerate upright overnight (or for 30 minutes in a deep freezer)
Serve in a pint in one quiet go, leaving the yeast in the bottle
Discard the yeast and rinse the bottle",[]

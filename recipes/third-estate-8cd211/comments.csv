Judge 1 (31/50):
Aroma (7/12): Distinct woodsy/mint aroma at medium low levels.  Moderate phenolic character (smoke/plastic) low caramel malt sweetness.  No DMS/diacetyl
Appearance (3/3): Copper w/ yellow edges.  Quite clear.  Loose off white bubbles pour low, fade to thin lace.
Flavor (12/20): Moderately high caramel sweetness w/ med-low alcohol notes.  Slight lemon acidity.  Low toasted malt.  Moderate bitternesss.  Balances fairly even and finishes w/ earthy bitter notes.  Med-low herbaceous / earthy character.
Mouthfeel (3/5): Med-thin body, low carbonation.  Finishes fairly dry.
Overall Impression (6/10): This is a nice example that hits many of the key flavor notes for the style complexity is nice although slightly oput of style.  Tilt balance back toward clean, ????? malt & improve yeast wrangling for a great example.",['23490']
23490,58343,tsvercauteren,"March 09, 2016  9:39pm","Judge 2 (35/50):
Aroma (7/12): Malt forward-sweet.  Spicy esters - earthy.  Low hops.
Appearance (3/3): Head-rocky, lingers at edge.  Golden color, clean
Flavor (13/20): Sweet malt comes through-not bold.  Low hop flavor.  Nice esters - spice pepper, some biscuit/cracker to the malt.
Mouthfeel (4/5): Effervescent crisp feel, good carb.  Low warmth.  Low body.
Overall Impression (8/10): A very nicely balanced beer.  Light body matched with great esters & phenols.  I might reduce the hops just a tad to elevate the yeast character more.  Good job.  Good for the subtle character.",[]

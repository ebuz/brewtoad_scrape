Blended all the ""extras"" in the blender and mixed with a Vodka Tincture (coconut New Amsterdam vodka ~2 cups). Will float tincture in fridge for 1 week during primary then strain and add to secondary.",[]

Will pitch with 1 step up (4x) and 1 clarified, mixed. Should give roughly 5x of 1 packet for 11 gallons (2 packets with stir plate equivalent or more).",[]

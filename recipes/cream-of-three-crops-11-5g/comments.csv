26265,12690,rockmodestly,"September 18, 2018  5:36pm","Ended up with a high efficiency, 1.051 and 10.75 gallons. Next time increase the amount of sparge water from 7g sparge to around 7.75 gallon sparge. The cream ale finished nice and low at 1.005 after three weeks in the primary. It is very hazy, sweet but not too sweet, and there isn't much corn flavor (it was likely all fermented away). 
Trying it at 68 degrees before cold crash and carb, this is a very tasty beer. This could become a nice house ale to have on tap that's not too high ABV, is refreshing, and has some flavor. It's very hazy but the aesthetic of that doesn't bother me (and may go away with some cold conditioning).",[]

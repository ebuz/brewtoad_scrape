Takes a little while to age to its full smoothness, maybe 2 months in secondary. Drank a bottle that was stored in cupboard for 6 months(probably 8 months old) and it was heavily oxidized. Seems to be a sweet spot for drinking this one. Better drank at a mildly cold temperature, brings out the chocolate notes more.",[]

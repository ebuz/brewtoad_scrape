Pitch the yeast into the cold wort and mix it in well. Make sure to pull a sample for a Fast Ferment Test and allow the temperature to rise naturally to 16-17 C (62-64F) where is should be held steady for the duration of the primary fermentation. Attaching a blow-off tube is advisable and necessary to remove the brown Kraeusen. The latter gives the beer a harsh taste if it is allowed to fall back into the beer.
Fermenting the beer too warm (20+ C/ 68+ F) may result in a more estery beer but oftentimes also in a beer that tastes thin and contains an excessive amount of higher alcohols.
On occasions brewers hear of a German rule of thumb that the pitching and fermentation temperature of a Weissbier should add up to 30. This is a rule that existed but it has been misinterpreted. The reference, which I found for this rule, refereed to the pitching temperature and the ambient temperature of the fermentation room. It was intend to keep the fermentation temperature from rising above 18 C (64 F) when small open fermented were used which were not temperature controlled [Narziss, 2005]. It is clear that this rule can not necessarily be applied to home brewing but, as with all beers, it is advisable to pitch Weissbiers below fermentation temperature.
The primary fermentation will take 3-5 days and is completed when the beer has reached the final gravity of the Fast Ferment Test. If bottle conditioning is used the primary fermentation may also be considered complete if the gravity of the beer is within ~0.7-0.8 Plato (~ 3 gravity points) of the FFT's final gravity.",[]

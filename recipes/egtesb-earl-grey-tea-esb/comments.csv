I am planning a brew with Lady Grey (a more fruity version of earl grey) and was going for an english pale ale style.  I'm shooting for a bit lighter than you have here, and on the sweeter side. Also - sorachi ace and earl grey sounds like an interesting flavor profile!",[]

Mine turned out to be far too yeasty and you could hardly taste the earl grey. It was pretty lemony though. Let me know how your's turns out!",[]

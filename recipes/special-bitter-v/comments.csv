May be closer to an ESB or brown ale in the end.  We'll see.  Also, hard to guestimate ibu's as I boiled at least 70 min. maybe more.  2L starter on the 1469.  Some of the top off water hit my hands as it was coming out so if it gets infected, that'll be why.  Going to try to keep this in the low 60s.",[]

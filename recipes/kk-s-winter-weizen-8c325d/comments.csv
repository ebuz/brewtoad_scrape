23096,71349,spookify,"December 21, 2015  2:38am","Notes: pecans didnt come through. White Wheat or London Ale give the beer a light carmal or soft vanilla note in the middle. Very dark around 30+ SRM.
Next Dunkel more research: Possibly 2+ pounds of pecans roasted same way. Remove black malt and use 0.25 roasted barley. Remove/Replace White Wheat or research if Londan Ale is giving the middle flavor.",['23198']

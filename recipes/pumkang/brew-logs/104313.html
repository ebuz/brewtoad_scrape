<td><p>01. Yeast starter (800 mL)
<br />I boiled 2 cups of water with 1/2 cup of DME. I let it cool to 80°F and shook the White Labs British Ale Yeast (WLP005) really hard to mix it up. It was still a little cold and was the consistency of jello. I should have let it warm up to room temperature. I added it to my 2 L Erlenmeyer flask and it came up to about the 800 mL mark. I added the stir bar, covered with sanitized foil, and turned on the stir plate. After a while I noticed strange white flecks in the starter and was concerned. I learned that these were actually the flocculent yeast and is normal. I let it sit for over 24 hours and thought I needed to put it in the fridge to get the yeast to drop out of suspension so I could decant before pitching, but I don't think I needed to do that.</p>

<p>02. Pumpkin (4#)
<br />I started with two 4ish pound pie pumpkins. I cut the first one in quarters and removed the pulp and cut each quarter into 4 more pieces. I line 2 pans with aluminum foil and put the pumpkin on there, sprinkled some brown sugar, ground cinnamon, and clove. I cut the other pumpkin into eights and that seemed to work out as well if not a little better. I baked them for about an hour and a half at 350°F. I took them out, let them cool, and then sprinkled some honey, ground nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice, and baked for another hour at 350°F. Maybe next time I can experiment with a little higher temperature and longer cook time. After the pumpkin cooled, I was able to separate the soft pumpkin meat from the hard pumpkin shell.</p>

<p>03. Sparge water (1 gallon)
<br />I heated a gallon of sparge water to 160°F in a 5 gallon pot in preparation of pouring over the grains/pumpkin after the extract step. After doing some reading on the differences between mashing and extracting, this step might be more pertinent only if I'm mashing.</p>

<p>04. Heat water (5 gallons) and "mash" specialty grains, pumpkin, and graham crackers
<br />I heated 5 gallons of water to 170/180°F (I didn't do a very good job of temperature control - that was bad of me). I steeped the specialty grains, pumpkin, and graham crackers for about 60/75 minutes. I probably should have done a "mash"-type step with the pumpkin (and possibly the graham cracker if it turns out okay) for 60 to 90 minutes and "extracted" the specialty grains for 30 minutes. Instead, I put them all in the same grain bag in 5 gallons of water that was too hot, and left it all to steep for too long. I had a plastic pasta strainer that I used to strain/sparge the pumpkin and grains. I pulled the grain bag out of kettle with a pair of tongs and put it in the strainer which I rested on one side of the kettle with one hand. With the other hand, I poured the gallon of water on the bag through the strainer. Since the strainer was plastic, it got very soft due to the heat and it fell in the kettle as I poured the hot water on it. Since this wasn't a true "mash" step, I don't think I needed to sparge. If I do a mini or full mash in the future, I will have to come up with a better way to do it - either a bigger, better strainer, or a separate mash tun.</p>

<p>05. Increase heat and add extract
<br />I increased the heat to start the boil. I started by adding the Briess golden light LME, 2x3.3# containers. The first one I opened and started pouring when I realized that I forgot to soak it in hot water to make it easier. I filled it with hot wort and took the other container to the sink and started running hot water on it. I emptied the first container again and rinsed it a few times to get out as much as I could, then opened the second container (it hadn't been warming for long) and dumped it in the pot. I mostly filled it with hot wort, screwed the cap on, and shook it a bit to get the last bit out. The lid exploded off and showered me with hot wort and taught me a valuable lesson to never again shake a plastic container filled with hot liquid. Once the LME was added, I cut a corner off of the first bag of Pilsen Light DME and started to pour it in the brew kettle. The little hole kept getting plugged with rehydrated DME so I ended up cutting the entire top off of the bag and it poured much more easily. I stirred the wort with a wire whisk to make sure the DME was fully dissolved and repeated the process with the remaining bag and a half of DME.</p>

<p>06. Boil
<br />Once the boil started, it was time to add the boil ingredients. I started with the .75# cane sugar and .25# brown sugar after the hot break, and then the following after I started the timed boil:
<br />@60 - Add .75 oz Magnum hops (bittering)
<br />@15 - Add .25 oz Sterling hops (flavoring)
<br />@10 - Add .5 tsp yeast nutrient and 1 whirlfloc tablet
<br />@05 - Add .5 tsp ground nutmeg, 2 Tbsp fresh ginger, .5 tsp ground allspice, 1 cinnamon stick, and about 6 cloves</p>

<p>07. Cool to 80°F
<br />I have a decent routine down for cooling - the laundry room sink is almost a perfect fit for the brew kettle. I put it in there, add water and ice cubes/frozen gatorade bottles, and stir occasionally with a sanitized whisk. In reading How to Brew by John Palmer, putting oxygen in the wort at greater than pitching temperature is bad, so stirring gently and slowly is best. I added a small amount, maybe a quart, of water to help the cooling process but I didn't want to add too much in case I was close to 5 gallons. The water and ice is replaced as it gets hot in the sink. An immersion, if not counterflow, chiller might be a good investment for future batches - I think I'll be able to make one for a reasonable price.</p>

<p>08. Aerate and pour into fermenter
<br />I aerated the batch by whisking it vigorously for a minute or two. It felt like I got a lot of good O₂ in there. I sanitized the fermenter, then poured in the wort and ended up with almost exactly 5 gallons.</p>

<p>09. Take OG reading
<br />I sanitized my turkey baster, testing flask, and hydrometer and took my OG reading. It looked pretty close to 1.080 and the temperature was almost exactly 80°F and the hydrometer chart says to add .001 for each 6°F over 60°F. That puts the OG at 1.083, just .001 off my expected OG of 1.082.</p>

<p>10. Add yeast, aerate, and add airlock
<br />I decanted as much as I could from the yeast flask and poured it in the fermenter. I sanitized the lid, put it on, and shook it a little more for additional aeration. I sanitized and filled the airlock with starsan solution, and brought it upstairs to the bathtub where it will ferment in the pail for a few weeks until it's time to rack to secondary.</p>

<p>Lessons:
<br />Let yeast container warm to room temperature
<br />Don't shake yeast too hard before opening/pouring
<br />Those white flakes in the starter are flocculent yeast strains - perfectly normal
<br />Cutting pumpkins is hard - be careful!
<br />Don't "mash" specialty grains unless they're being mashed with base malts
<br />Use better temperature control
<br />Don't use cheap plastic strainer to sparge
<br />Don't shake a plastic container with hot liquid
<br />Cut the entire top off of the DME bags
<br />Use an immersion/counterflow chiller</p>

<p>Wants/needs:
<br />Strainer or mash tun
<br />Wort chiller (immersion/counterflow)

<br />I boiled 2 cups of water with 1/2 cup of DME. I let it cool to 80°F and shook the White Labs British Ale Yeast (WLP005) really hard to mix it up. It was still a little cold and was the consistency of jello. I should have let it warm up to room temperature. I added it to my 2 L Erlenmeyer flask and it came up to about the 800 mL mark. I added the stir bar, covered with sanitized foil, and turned on the stir plate. After a while I noticed strange white flecks in the starter and was concerned. I learned that these were actually the flocculent yeast and is normal. I let it sit for over 24 hours and thought I needed to put it in the fridge to get the yeast to drop out of suspension so I could decant before pitching, but I don't think I needed to do that.</p>

<p>02. Pumpkin (4#)
<br />I started with two 4ish pound pie pumpkins. I cut the first one in quarters and removed the pulp and cut each quarter into 4 more pieces. I line 2 pans with aluminum foil and put the pumpkin on there, sprinkled some brown sugar, ground cinnamon, and clove. I cut the other pumpkin into eights and that seemed to work out as well if not a little better. I baked them for about an hour and a half at 350°F. I took them out, let them cool, and then sprinkled some honey, ground nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice, and baked for another hour at 350°F. Maybe next time I can experiment with a little higher temperature and longer cook time. After the pumpkin cooled, I was able to separate the soft pumpkin meat from the hard pumpkin shell.</p>

<p>03. Sparge water (1 gallon)
<br />I heated a gallon of sparge water to 160°F in a 5 gallon pot in preparation of pouring over the grains/pumpkin after the extract step. After doing some reading on the differences between mashing and extracting, this step might be more pertinent only if I'm mashing.</p>

<p>04. Heat water (5 gallons) and "mash" specialty grains, pumpkin, and graham crackers
<br />I heated 5 gallons of water to 170/180°F (I didn't do a very good job of temperature control - that was bad of me). I steeped the specialty grains, pumpkin, and graham crackers for about 60/75 minutes. I probably should have done a "mash"-type step with the pumpkin (and possibly the graham cracker if it turns out okay) for 60 to 90 minutes and "extracted" the specialty grains for 30 minutes. Instead, I put them all in the same grain bag in 5 gallons of water that was too hot, and left it all to steep for too long. I had a plastic pasta strainer that I used to strain/sparge the pumpkin and grains. I pulled the grain bag out of kettle with a pair of tongs and put it in the strainer which I rested on one side of the kettle with one hand. With the other hand, I poured the gallon of water on the bag through the strainer. Since the strainer was plastic, it got very soft due to the heat and it fell in the kettle as I poured the hot water on it. Since this wasn't a true "mash" step, I don't think I needed to sparge. If I do a mini or full mash in the future, I will have to come up with a better way to do it - either a bigger, better strainer, or a separate mash tun.</p>

<p>05. Increase heat and add extract
<br />I increased the heat to start the boil. I started by adding the Briess golden light LME, 2x3.3# containers. The first one I opened and started pouring when I realized that I forgot to soak it in hot water to make it easier. I filled it with hot wort and took the other container to the sink and started running hot water on it. I emptied the first container again and rinsed it a few times to get out as much as I could, then opened the second container (it hadn't been warming for long) and dumped it in the pot. I mostly filled it with hot wort, screwed the cap on, and shook it a bit to get the last bit out. The lid exploded off and showered me with hot wort and taught me a valuable lesson to never again shake a plastic container filled with hot liquid. Once the LME was added, I cut a corner off of the first bag of Pilsen Light DME and started to pour it in the brew kettle. The little hole kept getting plugged with rehydrated DME so I ended up cutting the entire top off of the bag and it poured much more easily. I stirred the wort with a wire whisk to make sure the DME was fully dissolved and repeated the process with the remaining bag and a half of DME.</p>

<p>06. Boil
<br />Once the boil started, it was time to add the boil ingredients. I started with the .75# cane sugar and .25# brown sugar after the hot break, and then the following after I started the timed boil:
<br />@60 - Add .75 oz Magnum hops (bittering)
<br />@15 - Add .25 oz Sterling hops (flavoring)
<br />@10 - Add .5 tsp yeast nutrient and 1 whirlfloc tablet
<br />@05 - Add .5 tsp ground nutmeg, 2 Tbsp fresh ginger, .5 tsp ground allspice, 1 cinnamon stick, and about 6 cloves</p>

<p>07. Cool to 80°F
<br />I have a decent routine down for cooling - the laundry room sink is almost a perfect fit for the brew kettle. I put it in there, add water and ice cubes/frozen gatorade bottles, and stir occasionally with a sanitized whisk. In reading How to Brew by John Palmer, putting oxygen in the wort at greater than pitching temperature is bad, so stirring gently and slowly is best. I added a small amount, maybe a quart, of water to help the cooling process but I didn't want to add too much in case I was close to 5 gallons. The water and ice is replaced as it gets hot in the sink. An immersion, if not counterflow, chiller might be a good investment for future batches - I think I'll be able to make one for a reasonable price.</p>

<p>08. Aerate and pour into fermenter
<br />I aerated the batch by whisking it vigorously for a minute or two. It felt like I got a lot of good O₂ in there. I sanitized the fermenter, then poured in the wort and ended up with almost exactly 5 gallons.</p>

<p>09. Take OG reading
<br />I sanitized my turkey baster, testing flask, and hydrometer and took my OG reading. It looked pretty close to 1.080 and the temperature was almost exactly 80°F and the hydrometer chart says to add .001 for each 6°F over 60°F. That puts the OG at 1.083, just .001 off my expected OG of 1.082.</p>

<p>10. Add yeast, aerate, and add airlock
<br />I decanted as much as I could from the yeast flask and poured it in the fermenter. I sanitized the lid, put it on, and shook it a little more for additional aeration. I sanitized and filled the airlock with starsan solution, and brought it upstairs to the bathtub where it will ferment in the pail for a few weeks until it's time to rack to secondary.</p>

<p>Lessons:
<br />Let yeast container warm to room temperature
<br />Don't shake yeast too hard before opening/pouring
<br />Those white flakes in the starter are flocculent yeast strains - perfectly normal
<br />Cutting pumpkins is hard - be careful!
<br />Don't "mash" specialty grains unless they're being mashed with base malts
<br />Use better temperature control
<br />Don't use cheap plastic strainer to sparge
<br />Don't shake a plastic container with hot liquid
<br />Cut the entire top off of the DME bags
<br />Use an immersion/counterflow chiller</p>

<p>Wants/needs:
<br />Strainer or mash tun
<br />Wort chiller (immersion/counterflow)

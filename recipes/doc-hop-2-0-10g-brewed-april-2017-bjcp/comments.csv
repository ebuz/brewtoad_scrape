25063,71349,spookify,"June 26, 2017  4:30pm","Judges noted the thin body but were not put off by it. There was a 50/50 split on if this beer was malty enough. Some said it was perfect and some said it needed more malt. All judges agree'ed that this beer needed a little more something; mostly being hop flavor or better balance when it comes to flavor. It was good/excellent however was missing something.
3.0 I am adding 1oz hops to the boil and also doubling the second dry hop amount. (Will also re-confirm water profile) (Also dropping 0.25 lbs of Caramel as judges really picked up on it.)",[]

25027,71349,spookify,"June 09, 2017  3:07pm",pH = Registered very very low and kept dropping. Once it went below 4.90 I stopped looking at it and crossed my figures. Tasting the beer I can not pick up on off-flavors that this may have caused; however I will say that the body of the beer is very thin. Will need to keep a closer eye on water additional and possible raise our base pH goal to 5.4 instead of lowest of the low at 5.2... BJCP Feedback to come soon!,[]

Gelatin:
It's perfectly balanced malt and bitterness wise and huge citra flavor. We are surprised the aroma is light. End's medium-dry, low bitterness and huge citra flavor in the back cheek. All in all an amazing beer and very well balanced. Pretty hazy but color looks very good.",[]
24985,71349,spookify,"May 17, 2017  2:17pm","Citra Flavor is well balanced and a great taste, no off flavors on the citra. After 2 weeks carbonating there is an ever so small dankness that appears every once and awhile but still a huge citra flavor. Hop Aroma in a glass is still low however opening a growler you get a nice citra note. All the citra flavor came from the whirlpool and minamal dry hop. Be interesting to see how splitting Azacca and Citra in the Boil and dry hop will effect the flavor of the beer.",['25028']

Not overbearing at all, but is not something you pour a pint at a time of. I like it a lot actually. Hoping it lasts to thanksgiving :-)",['19573']

Honestly, 4 days after kegging I was concerned just how spicy it would turn out based on early samples... but now, it's incredibly well-balanced. My recommendation is wait at least 10 days after kegging.",[]

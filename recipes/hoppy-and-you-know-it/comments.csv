First I dry hopped with whole leaf and they didn't get submerged and this was left like this for ~2 weeks they smelled terrible.  The water lock had about 5 dead fruit flys in it it, I dropped the ball here. BUT THE BEER IS GOOD, it's funky and fruity and I hit it with another round of dry hops put in the keg.",[]

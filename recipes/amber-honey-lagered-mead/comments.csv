25675,2832,Elan,"January 21, 2018 12:56am","Ferment from Oct-Jan at 10-12 degrees C (=50-54 degrees F). It started very slowly, next time I will let it start at room temp and then ramp down to ferment temp. Tasted it in Jan and it retains a lot of honey aroma but is relatively dry. I am letting it do a few days at room temp (diacetyl rest, but I didn't get much diacetyl at tasting). Then will rack and ramp down to lager at fridge temp (est. 38 degrees F).",[]

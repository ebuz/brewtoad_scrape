20121,33020,DrummoRC,"November 25, 2014 10:07pm",Did you make this beer?  I ask because I wanted to know how it turned out - specifically with the full LB of Roasted Barley?  it seemed like a lot!  I recently brewed a porter with a very similar grain bill.  After I brewed it I asked myself if I put too much Roasted Barley into the recipe!!!!,[]

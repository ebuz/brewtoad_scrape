It would probably conform to the style otherwise. 
I love the halfling, I'm interested to hear about the results.",[]

I'm also thinking of trying aromatic in place of the Munich.
We bottled the first hop hash experiment. I ended up juicing a shitload of tangerines and grapefruit that people gave me and added them. Overall it's a really good beer (I believe it was called ""Hop Hash Red""â€”though it came out more amber). I'm assuming this will be the same, since it's the exact same hop set up, with the exception of the 5 minute boil addition, which I'm just doing to get a slight bit more bitterness.",[]

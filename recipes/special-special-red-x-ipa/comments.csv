I'm adding more hops, I just haven't decided yet. These were left over from the last recipe... I think last year I found an ounce of hop hash at flameout gave me the bitterness I was after, then I added an ounce at a time as it cooled off, or in the case of this last beer, I added all of it cold with the yeast.
I'm liking the results from this last hopping schedule a lot (except I don't think I'm a fan of the Mosaic, it's overpowering even in relatively small percentages), so I'll add three of the two ounce bags while cooling, then just dump them in the fermentor. The only downside is that I really can't reuse the yeast, cause it's so gunky, but it seems to be all clearing out just fine.",[]

I was going to do another Red X beer, cause it's the shit, but the Special B was all because you re-brewed the Bastard-ish clone.
The Special Roast (actually did order the right amountâ€”misread the invoice) was from my previous Red X beer, seems like it makes beers taste good... used it a couple times now I think.",[]

19513,41803,Kevin,"September 30, 2014 12:50am",Not happy with the malt on this one.  The hop character is pretty good but it needs a little more sweetness.  The OG was too low 1.055 and the FG was too low as well... around 1.011.  Too bitter for the amount of alcohol / maltiness.  Next time I need to shoot for a higher starting gravity and maybe a less attenuant yeast variety.  Perhaps a mash of 156-158 might help this one out a lot.,[]

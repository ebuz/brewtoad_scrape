Firstly at the bottom of the mash tun clean straw/hay is added that would act as a filter. (+ I guess it adds the straw flavour a bit?) When running off the wort, do it straight to sanitized fermenter rather than pasteurising it same with hop tea.
Nice to see someone pay interest in our traditional brew. If you want more info can find me on facebook :)",['24275']

This came out rather phenolic the first time around - possibly because the yeast that I was using was harvested from a previous batch and may not have been strong enough. You're inspiring me to give it another try and incorporate the straw.,['24310']

Yeast wise traditionaly fresh bakers yest is used same as in Sahti, but now days people tend to go for either Lager yeast but make it as an ale or S-04 dry yeast. But it is all the fun to play around. Good luck if you make another one and let me know how it goes!",['24867']

What about baking the grains? How and when should it be done right for Keptinis?",[]

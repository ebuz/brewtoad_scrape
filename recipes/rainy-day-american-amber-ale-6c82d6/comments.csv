You used a lot of different base malts which would work but their distinct flavors of each would probably get muddled together. I chose maris otter for the variation because of the desired color was easier to achieve and I could keep the spirit of the Caramel 15 L alive hopefully without it getting overpowered by the 120 L I added. So with the hops, I dont know if comet is that accessible here, so I added simcoe which should be in the spirit of what you are trying to achieve with the beer. We are thinking Tuesday for a brew next week. Dalton is on board and Cecelia will be off. Lets talk a bit more about this stuff tomorrow. Nice work.",[]

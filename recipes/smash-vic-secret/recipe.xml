        <NOTES>Whirlpool and dry hop additions of Vic Secret introduce appealing clean and distinct pineapple and pine characters to the beer. Lighter and less dominant than Galaxy.

The clean, distinct, fruit and pine characters of Vic Secret are best accessed by 
dry hopping or whirlpool additions. Late kettle additions have been found to 
impart a pleasant earthy character, but little fruit. Very high levels of alpha acid 
may also mean that brewers will find it easier to craft the right balance in their 
beer by dry hopping. </NOTES>

Its going to be a very dark and very very sweet IPA
-- a double IPA would be higher amount of Base Malt -- the Crystal is really supporting color
My suggestion would be to keep your crystal in line with the original IPA recipe (Same with Aromatic)
- if you want more 'malt' - just up your munich content...
ALSO --for a double IPA -- you'll want to mash really LOW in temp -- like 147-150 area -- and go a little longer to ensure conversion",[]

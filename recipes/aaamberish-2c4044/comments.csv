24859,63946,Rickster9,"April 03, 2017  1:27pm",Brewed this up on 04/01/17. Its a variant of a previous recipe. My first try at a partial mash. It seemed to turn out great. We will see in a few weeks. I am still thinking of doing some dry hops but not sure yet. Will do a beer review in a month or so.,[]

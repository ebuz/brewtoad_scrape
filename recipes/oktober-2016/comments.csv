Final Gravity: 1.011
SRM: 9.8
IBUs: 29
Boil Time: 60 minutes
Directions
Conduct a mash at 151° F (66° C) for 60 minutes then sparge.  Collect roughly 6 gallons of runoff and bring to a rolling boil.  Once at a rolling boil add 1.5 oz of Hallertauer hops and allow them to boil for the full 60 minutes.  Be careful when adding hops as you may encounter a boil over during this first hop addition.  With 20 minutes left in the boil add .5 oz Hallertauer hops.  After the boil, cool your wort down to around 50° F (10° C) and strain the wort in to your fermenter. Aerate the wort very well.  Once the wort is both aerated and cooled pitch the yeast.  Ferment around 50° F (10° C) for 4 weeks before bottling or kegging.  Carbonate for 2 - 2.5 volumes CO2.",['23726']

(1.35 qt per lb) so it should stay a bit warmer that 1.2 from the IPA.  assume 15 degree loss--STRIKE cutoff at 171 degrees",['24106']

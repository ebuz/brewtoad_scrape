Mash temp stabilized around 151 and it tasted like it converted quickly.  Gave it a full hour, though.  Boiled wort for an extra half hour before adding hops.  Thinking was to reduce dimethyl suflate.   Ground water is cold right now in January so cooled the wort way down and pitched a huge starter at around 50F.  We'll see.",[]
20769,9037,Jmat,"February 02, 2015  3:56am",Wrapped a wet towel around the fermenter to keep things cold.  Going to try to keep this at 50F for primary.,[]
20778,9037,Jmat,"February 02, 2015  5:36pm","This was brewed on 2/1/15.  I should also note that the yeast may be Bavarian Lager and not Bohemian Lager.  I can't remember.  It was an older (6 months) smack pack.  I activated it overnight and then did a 1 L starter.  It took a few days to ferments out, presumably due to the age of the yeast.  I then stepped up to a 2L and then did 2L again.
It's chugging along now.  I've got the fermenter in the corner next to the drafty back door with a wet towel around it and it is so far holding at 52F.  It supposed to stay pretty cold out so hopefully I can just leave it there.  If it starts to climb, I an always put it in a water bath as the ground water is currently around 50F.",[]
20861,9037,Jmat,"February 09, 2015  9:48pm",2/9/15 - I kept this near the door this whole time and it never seemed to go over 53F or so.  Spent alot of time in the mid-40s.  It was warmer yesterday and I think it heated up a bit.  Sample was around 57 or 58 when I pulled it and rad 1.010 so gravity today is 1.009 (hydrometer is calibrated to 68F).  Moved fermentor to dining room for free rise/diacetyl rest.  Sample tasted good but green and yeasty.  Maybe some subtle diacetyl.  Hop/malt balance seemed good.  Color is nice and straw yellow.  Lots of yeast still in suspension.  I'll let this sit for several more days for a diacetyl rest and then rack it to a keg to go in the fridge to lager for a 4 to 6 weeks.,[]

Left it there for almost a week.  Transferred it to a corny keg two days ago and there it sits.  Tried a forced diacetyl test and it seems ok, but maybe a little bit of butter.  I'll double check the samples tomorrow to make sure it's clean.  P)robably let it sit at room temp, 66Fish, for a few more days to clean up and then I'll gradually bring it down.  First I'll put it near the door and then stick it in the kegerator and let it sit for 4-6 weeks at as cold as I can get the kegerator.  Tasted pretty good.  Yeasty, and some diacetyl (Am I imagining it.  Certainly there was no strong butter odor, but I feel like I taste it a little bit).  Color is spot on.  Nice and light.  Hop bitterness is fine.  It's balanced.",[]

This has since been sitting in the kegerator under about 8 psi for about two weeks.  A glass of water with a thermometer left in overnight read at around 32-33 degrees so that's good.  Checked it a week ago and it was yeasty and lots of off flavors, but you could taste a good beer underneath.  Checked it again today and it's much better.  Really pretty good.  Still a bit hazy in terms of color and there's a bit of graininess and it could be smoother.  I suspect this will be really really good by the end of the month.  I plan to let it sit until then.  If it's not crystal clear, I suppose I can try t fine it, but I'm guessing that won't be necessary.  I upped the psi to around 10 today as I think it could use some more carbonation.  Looking forward to seeing how this tastes in a few weeks.",[]

It was too cold with initial samples but I've got the kegerator stabilized at about 40 now.  That seems to be about it's best stable high end temp.  I read somewhere that helles should be served a bit warmer so maybe I'll try messing with the temp more when it's actually on tap.",[]
21975,9037,Jmat,"May 17, 2015 12:41am","Had this on tap for a few weeks.  Really, really good.  Maybe slightly more aroma hops, but I wouldn't change much.",[]

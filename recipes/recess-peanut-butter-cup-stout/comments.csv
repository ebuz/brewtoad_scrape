Why do you say that the secondary is N/A? Especially after a short primary.  Is the conditioning done in a keg, and that's why?  Even so, 17 days seems like a short rest, especially for a stout.",['18484']

I of course did a secondary, and my notes say,   ""3/4oz of artificial peanut butter flavoring from LorAnn Oils in the secondary.""  Secondary was in a carboy.  I poured a small sample and kept adding drops of flavor until it tasted right, then scaled up the amount to put in the carboy.  I think I overdid it a bit.  (Plus I had some acetylaldehyde fighting it.)  Next time I'll be a bit more subtle with the PB flavor - I have some powdered PB2 I might try as well.",[]

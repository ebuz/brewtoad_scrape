Adding it in secondary helps keep it from foaming over during primary but also means more rackings before it is settled and  ready to bottle. This goes for any addition of simple sugars to a beer. Adding to the beginning of the boil is unnecessary and just makes for a thicker boil and more browning of your wort sugars and higher risk of scorching.
Also I did a new version a month ago based on this with different spices. Be warned that a little nutmeg in beer goes a long way. A teaspoon is a good starting point. This year I added some anise, sage, rosemary, thyme to the more typical pumpkin pie/holiday spices. Makes it much more complex and made it a bit more unique.",[]

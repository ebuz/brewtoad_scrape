It is great for hot days BBQing or doing work around the yard.  Even though it is full of hop flavor and refreshing it will get the job done.  It is almost 6% ABV.  Let me know what you think if you make it.
Next time I make this beer, I will use Magnum hops for the first 2 hop additions than switch to cascade and than Citra hops.  I like the clean crisp bitter hop flavor from the Magnum hops.
If you have any questions or suggestions, let me know.",[]

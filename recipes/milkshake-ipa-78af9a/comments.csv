26029,54439,Peterbrau,"May 31, 2018 12:37am","Sorry for the late reply, I don't know why there aren't notifications for these things.  The oats are a typo, I added those during the mash.  The lactose was added with 10 minutes left in the boil.  I'll update the recipe to reflect this.  Cheers.",[]
26030,54439,Peterbrau,"May 31, 2018 12:38am","Nevermind, it won't let me alter that.  For future reference, the white wheat and the oats are added in the MASH not the boil.  I add the lactose with 10 minutes left in the boil.",[]

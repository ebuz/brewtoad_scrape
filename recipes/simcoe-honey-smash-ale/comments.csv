17678,11549,Elsmore bros.,"March 19, 2014  3:16am","Brewed for the first time on Wednesday the 19th of March 2014. Our first SMaSH (single malt and single hop) beer. We have a lot of Simcoe pellet hops to use up, a great dual purpose hop for bittering or aroma. Pip had some honey so chuck that in too and we now have a honey smash...why not? This is the first time we are adding hops to the mash tun, and the first time we have hops added from mash to flame out. So a first for Elsmore bros. We'll keep you posted on the result.",[]

19280,14602,mneil,"August 25, 2014 11:11pm","80 Minutes mas. Strike temp at 161 degree and was supposed to hit 150. Ended up instead at 141. Boiled another 0.5 gallons and added which brought it up 145. Then I panicked and ran another 0.6 gallons out of the tun and boiled, then put back in the mash. Hit 150 and held for 60 minutes. 
As a list:
10 minutes at 141
10 minutes at 145
60 minutes at 150
Mash out with another 0.5 gallons boiling. Vorlauf, and sparge for 15 minutes. Added the remaining 3.5 gallons (should have done 4 but added .5 earlier because of temp) and sparged for another 40 minutes.",[]

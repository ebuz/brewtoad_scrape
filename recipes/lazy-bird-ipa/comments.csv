I don't know who the original brewer was, but the outcome was fantastic!  Kudos to the originator!  It was my second AG brew and since then, I've brewed it twice with the same results.  I decided to substitute Falconer's for the Citra.  It's in primary right now.  Going to rack to secondary today or tomorrow depending on my readings.  Next time, might move the 5 min. addition to a whirlpool addition after flame out and let it steep for 20 min. or so.",[]

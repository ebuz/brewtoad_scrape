Malt - too subtle.  Would like to amp up the maltiness, probably adding 5% Munich to the next batch and a couple more ounces of Crystal 40L.  I don't know that using the Maris Otter really gets me much - might switch to American 2-row.
Bitterness - No complaints.  40 IBU is about right.
Hop Flavor - I'd like something a little more fresh and green.  My Cascade hops were pretty old, so I should have added more.  Might also add some Simcoe as well.
Clarity - decent, not great.  The wheat might be the cause there.  Will pull out the wheat next time.
Head Retention - good, though pulling out the wheat will cause issues.  Need to keep an eye on that.  Maybe do a bit of a step mash?",[]

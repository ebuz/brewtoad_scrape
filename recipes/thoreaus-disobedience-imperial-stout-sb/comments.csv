Am going to boil a teaspoon of yeast energizer & 1 teaspoon yeast nutrients (shouldn't be necessary but won't hurt), stir the beer up, heat it up maybe 2 degrees f. and pour the energizer/nutrients in.  Also will pick up a pack of US-05 while out tomorrow as another option.  Flavor is green but good, almost balanced but will be so much better if I can get it down into the low 1.020s.",[]

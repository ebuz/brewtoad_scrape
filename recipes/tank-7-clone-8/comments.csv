21568,32419,Stevoreno,"April 07, 2015  4:12pm","It turned out really nice but nothing like Tank 7.  This was in my early days of brewing and I didn't really know much about cloning a recipe.
This beer was slightly darker then Tank 7 and didn't really have the Belgian yeast profile.
However it turned out to be a great session beer. Very drinkable especially on a hot day.",[]

21374,52461,Pop top,"March 22, 2015 11:33pm",I brewed this beer on Friday 3-20-2015.  I am using a new pot and I ended up with 8.5-9 gallons of beer.  I thought I had 10 gallons but when I emptied it in to my 2- 6 gallon fermenting buckets I realized I came up short.  I was not able to add more hops to make up for the extra malt.  The local brew supply store I use did not have crystal 45 I used crystal 40 and increased the amount a .25 lbs to make up for the difference.  I guessed on the extra amount.  I am going to ferment for 3 weeks.,[]

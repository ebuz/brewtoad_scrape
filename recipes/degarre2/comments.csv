24865,28157,richardsj13,"April 05, 2017 10:56am","Thanks for the review and comments.  The suggestion to bump up the sugar sounds good, and get's ABV more in-line with the real thing.  This version turned out slightly different than the one w/ WLP530; a bit more bubble gum esters.  I like the 530 version better, so will go back to that for future batches.
The judges also liked the original recipe that I submitted to California State Fair (http://reggiebeer.com/ReggieWeb.php?Web=1000219). Definitely a key beer in the rotation now!",['24934']

    Congrats on the wins.  I see your quad also tood 2nd.  I'm gearing up to brew one and wonder which of your quad recipes took the prize?  Thanks. again.  I'm about 1/3 of the way through drinking the Degarre clone and it just keeps getting better with every week in the bottle.  
Best, Chris",['24949']

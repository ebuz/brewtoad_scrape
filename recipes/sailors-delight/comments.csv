The recipe is good and I think I am finally getting better at brewing. I picked this for the Hop quantities. Its nice to have all the quantities in round ounces. I hate when you have a recipe that requires 1.2 oz. of a hop. I really don't think 2/10ths of an oz. of hops will make much of a difference in a 5 gal. batch. I also hate having to put a bag of 8/10ths of an oz. of hops in the freezer. i printed this recipe out and put a star on it to remind me to make it again. I used Safale US-05 Beer Yeast instead of the California Ale Yeast and it came out fine. Safale US-05 is what I have used in all my IPA brews. It ferments vigorously for a week and then stops and settles. Thanks and Cheers!!,[]

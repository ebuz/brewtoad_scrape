19224,21959,btaylor45,"August 19, 2014  9:25pm","Yeastman, the beer turned out great but not really a Prior 8 clone. I would do away with the D-180 syrup and use maybe the D-90.  The D-180 has a harsh quality.  I used a two step infusion mash (142F for 40 mins, 160F for 40 mins) this is what they use at the brewery.  Sugars added 3 days into fermentation.  This beer is all about the yeast and if I lived in Western Europe I would culture the yeast from the bottle but being in the states I don't have that option (They put lager yeast in the bottle for NA shipments).  I would even harden the water. I hear the water in West Flanders is a bit on the hard side. 
Taste was good but would have liked a more silky mouth feel and a bit more plum flavor from the yeast.",['19253']
19253,57242,yeastman,"August 22, 2014  4:26pm",Thanks Taylor. Gonna be brewing a version of this I came up with on Sunday. Defo gonna try work our a similar mash schedule. I'm using wlp530 which is aparently where St. B got theirs from. I live in a hard water area so I generally leave it. Did you add yeast for bottling think I may leave that part out.,[]

But, have no fear I have stumbled upon safbrew abbaye and I believe this is there yeast in dry form. Rich flavors of toffee and plum with a hint of spice. My eyes lite up sampling this yeast for the first time. 
By the way I hate using brewtoad so if you want send me an email at bryantaylor18@gmail.com go right ahead. Brew toad is way too buggy for my liking",[]

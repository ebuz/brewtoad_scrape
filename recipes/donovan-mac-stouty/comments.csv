Bring 9 quarts (9 L) of water to 166 °F  (74 °C) and mix in the malts and baking soda. The temperature should fall between 154–156 °F (68–69 °C). Hold mash for 60 minutes before sparging. 
Recirculate the wort until clear and then run off wort to the kettle. (read the pdf here if you don't know what the hell recirculating wort means: http://www.northernbrewer.com/documentation/MashingSparging.pdf)
Once the top of the grain bed is covered by an inch of wort, begin sparging with 176 °F (80 °C) water. Collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort.
Bring wort to a boil, add hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add Irish moss 5 minutes before the end of boil.
Cool wort to 70 °F (21 °C), aerate, pitch yeast and ferment at 70 °F (21 °C).
Rack after 10 days and a second time in another 14 days. Then prime, bottle and hold 7 days before drinking.",[]

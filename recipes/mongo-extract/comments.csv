17359,22788,danfdeblasio,"February 16, 2014 11:54pm","Hi Victor, I actually used an ale yeast, I guess I entered it wrong and I cannot seem to find my notes.  I'm sure it was like 1056 or something similar.  I fermented at room temp (70-76) for 2 weeks-ish (I may have gone a little over) but transfered  to a secondary after about 7 days when I dry hopped.  This is a recipe I found in my brewstore that we adapted to be extract.",[]

batch 2 was 6.5, pulled just over 6---not sure of exacts on each, but bottom line was under 13 gal, should have topped up to 13. 
longer boil, plus less volume, plus a bit better efficiency (did pilsner help conversion, like when adam does that at burley?) gave me under 10 gal
a bit under 5 in each fermentor, at 1062
pitched two packs of s189 and 2 packs of s 3470 at around 58 degrees (after chilling and then sitting in the fridge at 40 for the afternoon)
left at 40 ambient for 2 weeks, then raised it up to 65 ambient","['25129', '25152']"

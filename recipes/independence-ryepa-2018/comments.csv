Might be interesting to do it with all noble hops one year. One thing I might note to change is to add just a little carapils as it has a bit of a “thin” feel to the body.,[]

Aroma: Not incredibly strong. Bready, grainy, and fruity with a hint of tropical or grape in there. Was stronger when it was fresher. Consider more dry hops. 
Taste: Excellent hop/malt balance. Bready and only a little sweet - which is perfect. A slight hop bite. The rye adds a certain taste that I can best describe as just “dry”. Almost on the path to astringent, but not there yet. It’s all good. 
Mouthfeel: carbed in the middle of the range which was perfect for this one. Some have felt a tad “thin” or “slick” in the mouthfeel which makes me wonder about adding a tad of wheat or carapils. May not be with fussing about. 
Rating: 4.25/5",[]

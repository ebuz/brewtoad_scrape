I tossed the old yeast, re-purposed the extract kit into an all grain recipe, along with some hops I had around. I racked it onto a fresh cake of 001 that just got finished with my Nate's citrus bomb. Fermentation began within a couple hours. After 10 days it's already at 1.020, traces of honey in the aroma, booze as well. I'm pleased with the results so far, I'm going to transfer the beer to secondary in a couple days and let it sit around for a while.
On a side note, I did toast the flaked oats with a tbsp or so of cinnamon at 300 for 30 mins, smelled great during the mash, but not much if any carried over to the beer.",[]

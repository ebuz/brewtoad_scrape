Can you tell me if you would recommend brewing this recipe? I've got all the ingredients and will probably brew this february next year. Thank you fir your reply and happy holidays.",['23118']

I have adjusted the Bittering addition to only 28 grams to get it closer in the range of ~40 IBU. Cheers!","['23133', '23419']"

Smelled and tasted great! Had the original during my brewsession and saved one for comparison later. Thanks for the recipe. 
Did you try the Nogne O porter as well? I really liked it and will try to make a clone later this year.",[]

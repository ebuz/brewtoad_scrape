Cheers!

The only reason I went with this style was because I had bought the wrong liquid yeast a few weeks earlier and I wanted to use it up. Surprisingly, I sent this beer into the AHA National Competition where it did OK. The beer comes out really bready and toasty, my example was very light on the clove flavor because I fermented it a little cooler in my basement. Hope that helps, good luck with making it!",[]

19036,49508,raiderrob67,"August 04, 2014  1:21am","Thank's, it was a long one and I am not very pleased. despite my best efforts I missed my target OG by 12 points. was expected @ 1.072 came in at 1.060. I double crushed the grains and did a 120 minute mash. my brew house efficiency was about 70%. pre-boil gravity was 1.065 and my evaporation rate was about 15%. post boil volume was 4.5 gallons, so I topped up to 5.5. not sure why my OG was so low?",['19044']
19044,54829,grainy,"August 04, 2014  5:23pm",maybe the mash ph was off?,['19045']
19045,54829,grainy,"August 04, 2014  5:25pm",I've been having problems with too low of ph and when it gets to low my points are off by about 10%,['19048']
19048,49508,raiderrob67,"August 04, 2014  5:45pm",Yea that is what I was thinking. also my mash water calculations where off I think? I had about 2 gallons more run off than expected. in the past batch's I noticed that my grain absorption rate was higher than the normal .17 gl/lb so I figured it was about .25 gl/lb. well this time it was .17 gl/lb. still working the kinks out of my system and method's.,['19075']
19075,22525,Derek Gillespie,"August 07, 2014 12:47am","What was your post-boil SG before you topped off?  If you watered down your beer, well, you watered down your beer....",['19079']
19079,49508,raiderrob67,"August 07, 2014  3:34am",I did not take a post boil SG before topping off. I now realize that I calculated my mash water wrong. I calculated for a grain absorption rate of .25 gal/Lb and it was actually .13 gal/Lb. I was supposed to have a boil volume of 3.5 gallons but ended up getting 5.5.,[]
18970,54829,grainy,"July 30, 2014  6:12pm",this one looks tasty. can't wait to hear how it turns out.,['18973']
18973,49508,raiderrob67,"July 31, 2014  1:10am","Yep, should be real interesting. the guy has a 57 gallon barrel that had been used for red wine. I am not sure how long we will be ageing it but it should be good.",[]

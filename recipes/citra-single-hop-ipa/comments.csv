22163,507,Samuel Neitzke,"June 11, 2015  5:08pm",I threw that in there a long while back. When I went from Extract to partial mash. at that time BT didnt have a PM option. I havent really updated it as i'm working on an AG version. Anyone already doing extract should 100% try Partial mashes. all you need is a slightly larger nylong grain bag. i could figure out a substitution (two row instead of a % of extract) if youd like.,[]

17167,507,Samuel Neitzke,"February 02, 2014 10:10pm","Hey all Thanks for the great questions.

White wheat is added as an adjunct with the specialty grains. It definitely helps with head retention and adds a little body (not as much as if I did a partial mash or in an AG batch, but the effect is noticeable). I also get hints of biscuit and doughy notes in the nose. Definitely let me know if you have varying results though, I'm always open to new data!
Rev 1 I did a 30 minute steep @ 155-160. Rev 2 and 3 I did a 45 minute steep and sparged the grains. which worked really well, and the difference was notable. you shouldn't need more than 45 mins to get a solid conversion, my guess is that the improvement came from sparging (pouring water @ 155 through the grains into the wort after the steep. 
4 ounces might be too much, who knows. I wanted a nose that punched you in the face with citrus, grapefruit and floral aroma, and that's what I got. The insane aroma from this beer really does change your perceived flavor (combination of flavor and aroma while tasting). try it with less if you want, but my results have been phenominal. :-)",['17698']

Few questions:
* How long did everyone end up keeping the beer in their primary? 
* Did you rack to secondary?
* If you're bottling, how much priming sugar did you use?

I left the brew in primary for ~3 weeks, it had stopped bubbling almost entirely by the time I went to bottling. I moved straight to bottle from primary. I used 5oz of corn sugar upon bottling.
The batch turned out phenomenally, amazing aroma and depth to the taste, strong without being too bitter, great recipe for a great IPA. I am considering using honey as my priming sugar in the next batch, as well as adjusting the timing I add the extracts to the wort (I added at the start of a 60 minute boil this batch, which I read can make it bitter, versus adding later in the boil)",['20737']

Thanks!","['19814', '20740']"
19814,58334,JynxZero,"October 28, 2014  2:57pm","I'm not an expert, I'm planning to do brew this recipe, this weekend as my third ever brew, so you might want to view the following with some skepticism, but as you haven't had a better reply...
I believe you dry hop FOR 7 days, rather than after 7 days.  My plan is to leave in the primary for 4 weeks total, then bottle straight from the primary.  I'll put the dry hops in for the last week of that.  After the main fermentation has died down, to avoid the CO2 blowing away the citra aroma.
My previous batch (different beer, but for comparison purposed) I used a secondary - One week in the primary, rack to secondary, leave for a week, then dry hop, then bottle.  A lot of older sources will recommend something along these lines.
However, reading around I'm discovering that there has been a big shift in opinion over the last few years.  People used to think that a secondary was absolutely necessary in this situation to prevent ""off flavours"" from a long time on the yeast cake.  However, many (most?) experts now think this isn't necessary at all in homebrewing, and adds risk of contamination, oxidation etc.  It may be that it once was (but modern yeast is more robust), or that it never was for homebrewing (but is in commercial brewing, due to much larger fermenting vessels).
It still seems to provoke considerable debate though!  For me personally, I'm nervous about contamination, so avoiding the transfer to secondary seems like a big plus to me, so I'm going to give it a go.  If I get some funky yeast tastes, I'll reconsider next time!",['22172']
22172,507,Samuel Neitzke,"June 11, 2015  5:29pm",Secondaries are for the most part unnecessary. Especially with ipa you want as minimal oxygen exposure as possible,[]
20740,507,Samuel Neitzke,"January 29, 2015  5:09am",primary/secondary  is of hot debate. I'm a convert that you can do everything in the primary vessel up to bottling/kegs. that said I 100% wait until primary ferm is finished before dry hopping. Hope it turned out!,['21903']
21903,36896,Mac Foster,"May 08, 2015 10:22pm",@Samuel - You might want to try racking the beer off the yeast after a week if you want to accentuate the hops with a clean and crisp profile.

22169,507,Samuel Neitzke,"June 11, 2015  5:18pm","if you really want a clean profile, use a clean fermenting yeast, US-05 or white labs California ale. I have an AG version all set to go. Just waiting to get the new electric system going before I test it. :-)",[]

I just looked at the prices of DME at my LHBS and was astounded at the price difference. eg. 6 lb. of 2 row @ 2.99/lb versus 6lb. of Pilsen Light DME @ $8/lb...adds up pretty quick. An all grain kit costs me between 20-30 but your recipe would cost well over 70. Is this a normal experience or am I missing something?

Regardless I am working on an AG version of this. Since its AG i want to play around a bit with some different malts and tweak a bit. but the hop schedule is going to be very similar. I will probably eliminate the flameout additions, and make a 15-10-5 min schedy, with 4 oz in the dry hop.

I decided I was done ""lagering"" your lager smile emoticon . Highly carbonated which is welcomed, with a HUGE head. I got a lot of yeast sediment, but it's probably because I kept having to move it around fridges and layed it down. Aroma: well let's just say my nose doesn't work very well, but I smell the caramel notes I'm about to talk about. I'm not super familiar with the Czech Pale Lager, but this seems far into the not-so-pale realm. In the taste I'm getting tons of caramel. The yeast character is amazing, but I'm just getting too much malty caramel characters. I was kind of expecting a bright, refreshing, light colored beer. The hop profile is awesome. I'm familiar with Saaz and Magnum because I've used them the most in my brewing, so whatever you did with those it is perfect. It would actually be way over the top on the hops for anybody other than us West Coast drinkers, but I love it. Perfect bitterness and flavor. If there was a way to dial back the Munich and Vienna I think it would be more to style (and I don't really what the style is I guess), however technically it is a great beer.",[]

Thanks for sending this bottle home with me. Nice and malty, which is just how I like my pilsners. If I had one critique, it would be that the color's a bit dark, and it might have a little more esters than I'd expect in this style (I guess that's two?... whatever, I'm drinking!). 
STILL, very good, very enjoyable. Nothing in this beer is off-putting. I've tried nailing this style before and I'd prefer your beer to mine. Getting that perfect lager profile is so tricky.",[]

Nicely carbed, balanced malt bill, clear appearance and no off flavors. My only complaint would be a small, ""gritty"", almost like the grains were crushed too much. At any rate, a great beer and glad to drink it! More please!!!",[]

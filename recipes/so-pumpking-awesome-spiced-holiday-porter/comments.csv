20315,60790,Banesy,"December 17, 2014 11:21am","This recipe comes in close to Arbor Brewing Company's Violin Monster.  If you swap over to a belgian yeast (or culture theirs from the bottle) and add some midnight wheat, it could be a pretty good clone.  The pumpkin came through very subtle when the beer was young but now as it ages, the pumpkin is hard to detect.  I had to mix two yeast strains because my English Ale yeast didn't seem to start.  After a full day of no activity (and a lame starter), I added US-05.  If US-05 took over, the beer most likely turned out drier than planned and perhaps didn't allow the pumpkin flavor to come through.  I find this brew lacking as a porter...there are no roasted malts added so it is more like a chocolatey dark ale.  If I could re-brew it, I would drop the chocolate malts to a 1/2 pound and add 5-7% of midnight wheat to add in some roasted porter tones.  Swap the yeast for a belgian strain and you might have the Violin Monster!",[]

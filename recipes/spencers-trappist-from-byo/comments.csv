Raise grain bed to 168 °F (76 °C) to begin the lauter process. Sparge with enough water to collect about 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort in the kettle. Boil for 90 minutes, adding the hops and Irish moss at the times indicated. After flameout, chill the wort down to 65 °F (18 °C) and pitch the yeast. You can then place in a warm space to allow fermentation temperature to start to rise to 72 °F (22 °C). Hold at this temperature during active fermentation. When active fermentation begins to settle down (kräusen begins to fall), increase the fermentation to 78 °F (26 °C) to be sure the yeast fements to completion. After all signs of fermentation have dissipated and final gravity has been reached, place the wort in cool storage at 50 °F (10 °C) for approximately 2 weeks. Carbonate to 2.5 to 3.0 volumes.",[]

19064,54798,Tad,"August 06, 2014  3:40am","This turned out to be a complicated brew. For whatever reason (relatively large volume of steeped grains?), I faced boil overs from start to finish. With five minutes left I put five whole bananas in the steeping bag. Had I to do over, I would have mashed them first. The O.G. was considerably higher than predicted (1.068 vs 1.057). Compounding matters, I had to pitch the liquid yeast from vial instead of doing a yeast starter because my flask (i.e., yeast starter) exploded on the stove last night. That concerns me because the O.G. turned out much higher than expected.",[]

The banana aroma and flavor is solid, but does not overwhelm the beer. The only thing I would do differently would be to let it age for a couple of months as it would only get better with time.",[]

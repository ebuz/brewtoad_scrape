18685,49508,raiderrob67,"June 30, 2014  8:15pm",Thanks. I tried to brew a pumpkin wheat beer last year but it was not very good. I was a complete noob (only a semi-noob now. lol)then I have been wanting to revisit the pumpkin ale using what I learned and what I know now. I also wanted to do a little different spin than the normal pumpkin ale by making a dark one. I noticed that there are actually a few out there so I guess it might work? I hope to brew it in August. not sure if I will be able to get fresh pumpkin then? if not I will use caned puree.,['18686']
18686,49508,raiderrob67,"June 30, 2014 11:26pm",Actually I should say that the pumpkin wheat beer was good but that it did not turn out how I wanted. I put 3 can's of pumpkin puree in the boil and did not strain when putting in fermentor. I lost over 1 gallon to the trub. also I think the spices clung to the solids so there was not a lot of flavor from them. I used Mangrove Jack's Bavarian Wheat M20 yeast. so it turned out to be a pretty good Witbier. the pumpkin flavor did come out more when you had food with it.,[]

18354,49508,raiderrob67,"June 02, 2014  1:50am","Deep gold to copper in color. nice head but not much head retention(could be from improperly cleaned glass?) Rich and malty with well balanced bittering. malty up front, turning to banana/ light clove, finishes dry with a lingering malt sweetness and warmth of alcohol.",[]
21384,62371,David Stelting,"March 23, 2015  7:59pm","I like the recipe, but I'm not interested in a banana or clove finish at all.   I've only gotten the Isomyl acetate flavors when my fermentation was too high temperature.   What temperature did you ferment at?",['21391']
21391,49508,raiderrob67,"March 24, 2015  5:29am","Not sure on the fermentation temp, may have gotten as high as 74 F? I was not controlling my temp's as well then as I am now. I think most of the flavor I was getting was just a young beer?",['21408']
21408,62371,David Stelting,"March 24, 2015 11:16pm","Cool, have you brewed it again since then?",['21410']
21410,49508,raiderrob67,"March 25, 2015  7:18am","No, but I should. I have been jumping from style to style when I should concentrate on 1 or 2. over the last 4 month's I have been able to get my pipe line built up a little so once I have a few different beer's on hand I may go back and perfect one's I have done. I will most likely do this in an AG BIAB variant rather than the partial it is now.",[]

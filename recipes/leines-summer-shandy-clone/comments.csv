I am trying the same recipe.",['18117']
18117,12075,Roofrat72,"May 08, 2014  7:30pm",Nope. No added sugar to the Kool Aid Mix!,[]

18720,52269,PBR,"July 05, 2014  3:07am","Well today I tried this finally.
Think the next batch will consist of 2 packets lemonade mix.  The lemon dominated the flavor, instead of the back end.",[]

19833,12075,Roofrat72,"October 30, 2014  2:59pm",It's what I used and it seemed to work. Mess with it and see what you can do! That's the best part about homebrewing. Taking something and tweaking it to make it your own!!,[]
20212,58558,Jason Walton,"December 07, 2014 10:53pm","Roofrat and other guys, just wanted to let you know I found this recipe about 1 yr. ago. The first time I made it without the Maltodextrin, and used 3 packets of lemonade. It was awesome, but 2 friends thought the lemon flavor should be toned down a little. 2nd time, at secondary fermentation, I used 2 lemonade packets, and the zest of about 1/2 lemon. Perfect. Doing it again tonight, but this time using maltodextrin for the 1st time. Thanks for the recipe, it's delicious.",[]
21086,63994,Marty Jahn,"February 28, 2015  8:43pm",Guys I bottle yet. When I bottle do i add priming sugar too? or just the lemonade packets?,[]
21590,65332,Lager Goggles,"April 09, 2015  8:09pm",I ran it with the 2 packets on Lemonade and pretty much a full lemon zest in the secondary. Turned out OUTSTANDING!  We are getting ready to run the same base but do a Lime version and an Orange version.,['21784']
21784,66029,aswistak,"April 28, 2015  4:07am",did you just do the full lemon zest in the secondary and add the packets before bottling or did you add the packets in the secondary as well?,['21872']
21872,65332,Lager Goggles,"May 05, 2015  6:12pm","Yeah.  Just zest the lemon a small bowl or something.  Dump it and the 2 Kool Aid packets directly into the secondary after you transfer it.  I have the ""orange"" version in the secondary right now.  Probably bottle it this weekend.  I'll let ya know how that goes.  But I just bought an Inkbird temp controller off Amazon to wire up for lagering so that project happens this weekend also.  :-)",[]
21785,66029,aswistak,"April 28, 2015  4:20am",I just tried an all DME version (3lbs Wheat & 3lbs Light) of this tonight and will report back on how it goes.,"['21873', '21993']"
21873,65332,Lager Goggles,"May 05, 2015  6:13pm","We did it All Grain just because we are into that now.  Plus All Grain takes longer.  Allows for more consumption during brewing.  LOL
Let me know how the DME version turns out.",[]
21993,66573,KjDreessen,"May 18, 2015 12:17am",Just wondering how the progress of your DME version is going?,[]
22040,66573,KjDreessen,"May 24, 2015  2:21am","Question for anyone, when I bottle I'm going to use 2 packets .23 oz packs of kool aid.  Do I also add any priming sugar for bottling?  Just hoping to get some clarification.",[]
22332,61332,Groundup,"July 06, 2015  2:18am",I would think you would have to add priming sugar. But I personally do not know if Kool Aid packs have sugar in them. I thought they didn't.,[]

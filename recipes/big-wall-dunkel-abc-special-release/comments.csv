19477,40760,Diesel,"September 26, 2014  6:19pm","This beer marked a lot of firsts for me.  It was the first beer I've brewed on an electric pilot system, the first 10 gallon batch, the first time I've used a conical fermenter (so no secondary transfer to introduce oxygen)  and the first beer I've brewed professionally.  I must say it turned out great (despite a small transfer pump explosion that I'm not going to go into details about, but I'm lucky to have my eyesight:)  I am humbled that the Adventure Brewing Company allowed me to be part of their history and success.  I enjoyed sitting at the bar quietly listening to customers order pint after pint and share disappointment when they were denied growler fills due to such a small batch.  I called this once ""Big Wall"" in the spirit of the Brewery's vision; adventure.  A  Big Wall is a climber's reference describing a rock face so large, that you must stay the night on the wall in order to reach the top (or a minimum of a two day climb distance.) and that being said, this beer brought big flavors to an already cherished traditional wheat.   Aside from a big wall being Adventure centric, I thought this name fit the beer in many other ways:  It took two vials of yeast, twice the brew volume of my 5 gallon recipe, two times the fermentation time, and was gone too quickly.  Can't wait to make the next one!",[]

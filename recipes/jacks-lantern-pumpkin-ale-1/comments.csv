19264,36880,Tilion Brewing Company,"August 23, 2014  2:06pm","I add the brown sugar to the mash as it affects the mouthfeel of the beer. I wanted the sweetness of the brown sugar without the caramelization you usually get by adding it to the boil.  By adding it to the mash it becomes part of the suspension.  This is a trick I picked up from Southern Tier that they use in their Pumpking recipe.   This year's version I am adding an additional 1.5 pounds to get to 2 pounds in total.  I also use Penzy's pumpkin pie spice mix and get it fresh every year.  Last years batch (this recipe) didn't last long.  I had to make two batches to get me through halloween and thanksgiving.  If you make a batch, let me know how it turns out.  Cheers!",[]

19754,17728,Matt Shotick,"October 23, 2014  7:55pm",Did you just put a couple of cans of pumpkin puree in with the mash? I was thinking about adding it to the boil instead so it would break down.  What do you think?,['19772']
19772,36880,Tilion Brewing Company,"October 25, 2014  2:46pm","Matt, I use two cans (64 oz each) of Libby's pumpkin puree.  I roast it for 40 minutes at 350 or until the top gets golden brown.  I found this adds a sweet pumpkin flavor to the beer.  I have only added the puree to the mash as I have already cooked the pumpkin there was no need to further process it...it will just settle to the bottom of your pot and you risk scorching your boil kettle.  I keep a sanitized wire coat hanger handy just incase my sparrage gets stuck.  I also use a fair amount of rice hulls with this recipe (1 pound).  The other key is to use fresh pumpkin pie spices.  This year I used last years spices and made a huge difference in my beer.
 Happy Brewing and Cheers!",[]

20608,36880,Tilion Brewing Company,"January 17, 2015  6:24pm","Ground up, you will want to stir it into the mash. There are plenty of fermentable sugars to get out of the pumpkin so you will want to make sure it is incorporated with the grain. Also as a tip make sure you use a pound of rice hulls as this mash can get sticky, especially if you have an infusion set-up.  Happy Brewing and Cheers!",[]

So to clarify your final recipe you added 2# light brown sugar, 1# rice hulls, 128oz Libby's pumpkin puree (roasted), but only 1 teaspoon of fresh pumpkin pie spices? I am wondering why only one tsp of these spices? I have made one pumpkin (Angry Pumpkin) and it was good but I added more spices to the boil (0 min) and did not get a real aroma/flavor off them. Is it because they are fresh spices? 
As a side note I will be making this later this week for the holidays, should go good with my smoked ribs and pulled pork I make for Halloween night.",['22690']

If you haven't started brewing this one yet, I recommend you see my Version 2.1 of this recipe as I changed the volumes a little after last years batch (128 ounces was way too much pumpkin and resulted in a stuck sparrage which was not fun.  I recommend roasting your pumpkin puree in a shallow baking dish for about a half hour or until the top starts to brown.  I have also switched to 2 lbs of dark brown sugar for a little more back bone.  In regards to the spices, I always use fresh for each years batch.  With fresh pumpkin pie spices you do not need to use as much.  Cinnamon is a tricky spice to brew beer with and can turn metallic on you if you use too much.  I played with a couple different versions of this recipe varying the amounts of spice mix and for me one TSP was enough to balance with the malt and the puree.  
I think, you are right a nice pumpkin beer would go well with smoked ribs and pork.  Enjoy and let me know how it turns out.  
Cheers - Tilion Brewing Company",[]

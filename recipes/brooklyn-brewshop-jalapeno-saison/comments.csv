This was the last batch I made and I'm not too sure I enjoy the flavor, I went with the pacific jade hops and liked their flavor and aroma paired with the jalepeno. But, I did feel that the jalepeno flavor was lacking. I also diced mine up, but it was on the smaller side.",['17259']

I brewed it again, but I doubled the peppers: adding a chipotle, and I didn't like the result.. .Chipotle spice had an almost ""bile""-esque flavor",[]

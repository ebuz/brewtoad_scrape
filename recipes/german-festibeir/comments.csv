I gave it to a German guy at a party, not telling him what it was, and her could recognize it as a nice German style beer, but said it was a good flavour profile, but not strong enough. He said that they were between 6 - 8%, so maybe scale up the base malts (Maris, Lager, Wheat, Vienna and Munich).",[]

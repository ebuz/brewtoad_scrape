18394,49508,raiderrob67,"June 07, 2014 12:21am",OK thanks. I want to keep it a little sweet and US-05 would take it down to far. what would you use?,['18395']
18395,49508,raiderrob67,"June 07, 2014 12:24am",Maybe I will add a mash step? mash for 45 min @ 155F and then bring it up to 160F for 15 min.,['18396']

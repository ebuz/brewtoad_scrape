I brewed this a few weeks back (my first partial mash attempt after a few kit beers). I think the brew went well (no chocolate addition).  Just debating whether or not to rack into secondary or wait and bottle out of primary.  Wondering how to get some of the unique flavors present in the granville winter ale.",[]

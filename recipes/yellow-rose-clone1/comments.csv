Lone Pint uses Kolsch yeast, which is what I use now. And double up on the finishing and dry hop amounts, and you should be closer to the ballpark. Happy brewing!",['24451']

I actually shortened dry hop time down to 6 days total and slightly cut the hops quantity back.  Now that Lone Pint is bottling YRose, it's great to try side by side!  Appreciate your comments- will def try w kolsch yeast.as well. - Happy Brewing- Steve",[]

19831,37184,Matt Householder,"October 30, 2014  5:35am","How did this turn out??? I'm considering using BH in a fruity, mosaic-heavy IPA, and was curious. Did it add any type of weird ""pithy"" notes or mouthfeel? And did you add the zest after fermentation had died down a bit, or before it started? I do a mosaic single hop pale ale, called space-whale pale ale (the 3.0 version is the most current, as we've played with it a bit every time we brew it, and had to adjust recently for the difference in Alpha-acid levels from last year to this year... but I'll shut up now.) and I think BH might totally work for a jacked up version of that. Give me a shout when you get the chance, please!",['19879']

Other judges thought it overwhelmed the style and became slightly pithy, but majorly ""potpourri-like.  My notes say that I thought it was ""soapy, but intriguing.""  I added the zest at flameout and left it in until bottling.  It's a very intense product to use, it was fresh, not dried.  I made a small 2.5 gal batch and should have used 1 oz, maybe even 0.5 oz.  I think it would play well with Mosaic, less is more with Buddha's Hand!",[]

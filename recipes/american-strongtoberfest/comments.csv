I wanted to experience an extreme and it was perfect for that. The Märzen yeast worked like a champ and attenuated significantly more than White Labs claimed it would (for the better). It was clear as glass, great head retention and mild lacing. 
This was a great place to start my quest for the ultimate märzen, but leaves much to be desired.",[]

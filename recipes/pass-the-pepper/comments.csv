18838,53781,Huskerbrew,"July 16, 2014  8:54pm",Brewtoad says 4...my other program says 5 for the SRM. Later on I'll work out the math on paper. Maybe I'll stick with the Santiam for aroma and go with something more traditional for bittering. Now that somebody is actually looking at this I guess I should make sure I actually fill out my brew logs.,[]

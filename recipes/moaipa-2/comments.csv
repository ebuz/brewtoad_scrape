I feel like this beer had less edgy bitterness for being 89 ibu compared to my BIPA which was in the 60-70ibu range.   I guess that is because the bipa is missing that mid/late/ whirlpool hopping to round it out.  
I also like the malt/hop balance of this beer, so this is going to be a great benchmark flavour reference for me!

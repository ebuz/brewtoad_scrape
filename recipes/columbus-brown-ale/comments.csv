With a good chunk of that being Marris , and a nice dose of caramel , it should turn out really well. Marris is highly modified malt and ferments out  fairly dry , so adding lots of crystal ups the mouthfeel and body a bit  . You can`t beat the taste of the mellow flavor of Marris ! Can`t wait to see your tasting video of this beer.  Cheers ,   Jim",[]

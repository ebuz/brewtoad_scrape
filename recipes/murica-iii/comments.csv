The recipe started as the Honey Amber which the Whitehouse released to the public.
http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/09/01/ale-chief-white-house-beer-recipe
Over 5 brewings:
•	We replaced the European Fuggles/Goldings with Cascade/Amarillo and opted for Safale US-05 because… Hey  this is ‘Murica!
•	The first two batches made with actual honey killed the body and dried it out way too much. We scrapped the honey and replaced with Honey Malt.
We also do a yearly harvest version of this with a big late addition of homegrown hops.",[]

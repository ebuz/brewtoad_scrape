The body and alcohol burn balance out very well...slight warmth from the high abv but not offensive.  The body is silky smooth.  
Brewing Notes;
Coffee added to mash was Pete's Major Dickason's
24hr before kegging, grind up ~ 0.5 lbs of coffee (used Biggbys for this recipie) and 1.5 oz of Cocoa Nibs, sterilize grain sock and add coffee / nibs to fermentation
Kegged on day 16 and added a touch of oak essence ~2 TBSP",[]

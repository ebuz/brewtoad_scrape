The bitterness was too high and the flavor and aroma was not right.  I decided to add a little Vienna malt for a slightly malty character along with a hop schedule with most hop additions late in the boil.  I also mashed at a higher temperature to also add some malt character since a session beer can be watery tasting due to the lower alcohol.  We shall see.  It already seems a little high on the gravity coming out of the boil.",[]

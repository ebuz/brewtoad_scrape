I was originally going to use both Cascade and Simcoe for the dry hopping in secondary, but decided to only go with a half oz. of Cascade hops, with about a teaspoon of lemon zest. Who knows if that will even be noticeable.  Left in primary for 7 days were it fermented around 75 degrees.  Transferred to secondary where it sat for 2 weeks at around 65 degrees.  OG and FG were spot on with what the recipe shows, giving us right around 6.1%.  I'll be sure to leave a comment on how it tastes in a week or two.",[]

It's very good.  I'm happy that my first original recipe turned out to be pretty decent.  Great color, although darker than most IPAs, tons of flavor, and great head.....",[]

JUDGE 1: 32/50
Aroma: 9/12 - Low levels of a lightly toasted malt.  Faint underlying honey-like sweet notes.  Faint fresh herbal esters
Appearance: 3/3 - Medium Copper, Clear.  Large foamy off white head that persists
Flavor: 12/20 - Moderately high levels of an herbal and resiny hop flavor.  Low phenolic notes of black pepper.  Malt notes are bready with hints of caramel as it warms.  Finish is dry with bitterness lingering.
Mouthfeel: 3/5 - Medium light body, moderate carbonation. Light alcohol warmth.  Slight prickling on palate - perhaps from a combination of the carbonation and alcohol.
Overall: 5/10 - While I do enjoy the flavor of this beer, it seems the balance may be a bit towards the hop flavor and bitterness.  The bread malt with faint caramel notes appear to be there but are dominated by the bitterness.
Checked Alcoholic (circled warming), astringent (circled harshness and wrote in ""light""), and phenolic (circled pepper)
JUDGE 2: 35/50
Aroma: 7/12 - Malty aroma, hints of earthy hops.  No fruity aroma.  No caramel aroma.  No diacetyl.
Appearance: 3/3 - Copper brown color.  Good head retention with fine bubbles.  Good clarity
Flavor: 14/20 - Malty flavor with a biscuity component.  Hop flavor is earthy. Hop bitterness is low. Medium dry finish. No alcoholic flavor. Hop bitterness becomes more assertive as the beer warms up.
Mouthfeel: 4/5 - Medium body.  Moderate to high carbonation.  No alcoholic warmth.  No creaminess. Not astringent. smooth tasting.
Overall: 7/10 - Good. Initial malt aroma.  Flavor is malty with hop bitterness better as it warms up.  Initial foamy head dissipates reasonably fast.

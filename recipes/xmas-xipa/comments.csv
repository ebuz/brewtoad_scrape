16632,34848,cpa4ny,"December 24, 2013 12:52am","Brewed on 23 December 2013.
No whirfloc - added Protofloc to the late boil.
Added honey only 5 minutes before the end of the boil; did a hop stand for 15 minutes.
Probably it didn't have a chance to fully dilute - original gravity came in at 1.065 - much lower than anticipated.
Oxygenated wort for 90 seconds with pure oxygen - pitched yeast at about 27c; a bit high.
Checked airlock on 24 December - no bubbling. I think it is cracked - hence, no bubbles. The fermentation hopefully started. Didn't open my fermenter to check.
Initially set the fermentation temp @ 18.5c - however, raised it to 19.5c on the 24 December. 
Using fresh Brewerkz British Ale yeast.",[]

It is 1.016; looks almost done, yet the fermenter still burps an occasional bubble every couple of minutes.
Decided to leave it on the yeast cake for a while longer (was considering moving the beer to the secondary today and adding the dry hops).",[]

Transferred to the secondary after purging the fermenter with CO2.
Added 5 gr of Polyclar VT + 1 oz of Cascade dry hops.",[]

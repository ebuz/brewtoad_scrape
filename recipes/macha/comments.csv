The superstition was said to have stemmed from the legend about a goddess named Macha, who is often associated with horses and races. Her husband, Cruinniuc, often bragged about her running speed. When the king of Ulster heard this, he dared Macha to race with his fastest horses. Even though Macha was then pregnant, if she failed to win, her husband would be executed. Despite her pleas for mercy, she was forced to run. Macha finished in first place, but exhausted, she underwent premature delivery in the field and bore twin sons. She then cursed the Irish men and their descendants, that they would experience pains as excruciating as those during labor. In the famous battle of Ulster, her curse spared her twins and 17-year-old Irish legendary warrior CÃºchulainn. Consequently, the young hero was able to win the war without soldiers backing him up. Macha, who just happened to be red-haired, has been greatly feared ever since.
In general, red-headed people are often said to be of fiery temperament. Meeting a red-haired woman is also believed to bring bad luck. Other current superstitions related to red hair are that a man bumping into a female redhead on his way to work will procrastinate and go back home, and a male or female redhead in a red coat is a bad luck omen.",[]

You have clover honey mentioned as an ingredient in the Notes, but not in the list of fermentables. In the Notes, you list Whitbread Golding as your 60 minute hop addition; yet, in the ingredients, you list Styrian Golding as your 60 minute addition.  Please correct these errors, the recipe is confusing, otherwise.",[]

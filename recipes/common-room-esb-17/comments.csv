The sparge water - originalyl calculated for 195F, was WAY too high. Strike water should have been closer to 175F - 180F, max.
Hit the OG of 1.056.
After three weeks of fermentation, FG was at about 1.020 for both the Safale 04 and the WLP English Ale yeast. So far, I like the taste of 04 more than WLP, but we'll see!",[]

It had much more fruitiness and complexity, whereas the S04, while quaffable, was sort of ""one note"" - bitter up front, some malty in the back, that's all.
Next time, brew two with WLP!",[]

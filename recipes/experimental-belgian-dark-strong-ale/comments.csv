This recipe was actually developed by my brother in law. Overall it is a decent brew. As with most Belgian strong ales, the bottle conditioning took significantly longer than a normal ale. I brewed it back in may, but only just opened the first one a few weeks ago.
As predicted by brewtoad, it is a bit on the sweet side due to the high gravity. So if I were to make any adjustments I would use less of the candi sugar. Though I'm not experienced enough to know how much to adjust it by. I would greatly appreciate any feedback!",[]

Sugars usually dry out beers a bit but candy may be slightly different. Might think about cutting back the darker grains also...",[]

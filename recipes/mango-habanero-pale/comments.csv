I would recommend making sure that any secondary fermentation is completed before packaging, I have a lot of very lively beer in the bottles!",['17324']

The fermentation defiantly restarted after adding the fruit, but the gravity finished at 1.006.  I used a Mango puree from the baby food isle at the grocery store, which I found much easier than using fresh mangoes.   This beer has been in bottles for two weeks now, so i'll be sure to bring some to KLOB.",[]

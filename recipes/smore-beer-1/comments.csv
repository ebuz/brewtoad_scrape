It's not perfect. It's definitely drinkable. It's really more of a cocoa vanilla porter. Came out really thin. Next time I make it I'm adding lactose to get more of a milk chocolate flavor. I don't know that I'd use the smoke again. I can't taste it at all, but I don't want to use much more than I did. The other smores beers I've had didn't use any smoke, though I think it's kind of an obvious way to evoke that feeling. Not sure how much vanilla I used. I did it to taste at bottling time, but that ended up being way too much after carbing.
Brewed on Sep. 21st, bottled on Oct. 11th. Fermentation was probably 3-5 days ~62, then ramped up to 70 over a couple days, then at 65 until cold crashed at 38 for the last couple days.",['21335']

Might be interesting with pilsen malt or something like that. I think the vanilla should be just enough to taste, not what tastes balanced, which is what I did. marshmallows aren't super flavorful, so the vanilla should be a little faint. Should also have gotten some dark crystal or maybe more roasted, to effect the flavor of burning the marshmallow. definitely needs lactose for residual sweetness.",[]

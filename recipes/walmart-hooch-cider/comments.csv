In a well sanitized fermenter, add:
1. Add 5 Gallons Walmart ""Great Value"" brand apple juice fom bottle or concentrate
- This brand contains only Ascorbic acid, which won't interfere with fermentation
2. If from bottle, no boil is necessary. If from concentrate and using tap water, I recommend boiling for a few minutes at least to sterilize (but I recommend bottle to save yourself the trouble)
3. Add sugar as simple syrup (2 parts water to 1 part sugar) and add to apple juice. I don't remember exactly how much I used, but you can measure gravity between additions to get to the level you wish. I hit about 1.080 with good results.
4. Pitch yeast and yeast nutrient and let ferment to completion (took about 2 weeks)
NOTE: I didn't actually use yeast nutrient for this and got really bad ""rhino farts"" or H2S smell, so be advised.
5. If bottling, mix a little over half a cup of dextrose with 1 cup water and stir. 
Carbonation took a long time for this oneâ€”a little over a month. The result is actually not bad. Tastes like a low-end cider with high ABV, like an edgy woodchuck. I may try adding some flavoring in the future to ""class"" this up even more. 
Cost: about 18 bucks for me, with apple juice on sale. The price was right.",[]

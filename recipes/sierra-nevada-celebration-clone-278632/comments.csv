24922,100139,Clifton Shoemaker,"April 24, 2017  9:46pm",OK...so had a first taste over the weekend. I also had a bottle of the real deal that I saved. The taste is almost spot on. The color came out just a tiny it lighter but almost not noticeable. The only other difference was the bottle had more carb bite than my draft version. Very pleased!,[]

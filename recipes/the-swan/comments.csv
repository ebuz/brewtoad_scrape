Fermented out well to 1.010 resulting in a roughly 4% ABV.  Pretty decent session IPA as it turns out!  Hop flavors are pretty juicy and dank at the same time, which is what I was going for.  I'll revise to a partial mash (mostly mash?) recipe and boost that OG with pale extract.  Definitely a hop profile to play around with.",[]

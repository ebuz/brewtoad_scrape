20490,62066,Eric,"January 05, 2015 10:36pm",I just bought the supplies to brew this. Can someone tell me where I can find the directions? Does the Candi sugar go in to the boil with the extract? What temp does it ferment at? is it just a primary fermentation or is there a secondary? How long do I steep the grains etc...?,[]

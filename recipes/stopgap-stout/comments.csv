17163,19838,skelly,"February 02, 2014  7:35pm",The Perle was actually from Germany and was used mainly because I have several kilos of it.  Fermented really well and after two weeks in cask it was excellently smooth with a superb flavour.  Fermented in fermentation bucket with glass immersion heater  and the whole thing in a fridge. With temp contollors on both fridge and immersion we can keep the brew to within a half degree of target and gradually allow the temp to rise slowly during the last third of the brew.  Final ABV 5.5%,[]

Coarsely mill the American six-row pale ale malt and place in a muslin bag. Immerse the bag in about 2 gallons (~8 L) of cold water and heat slowly, for about 30 minutes to 170–190 °F (77–88 °F). The steeping liquid must never boil! Lift and dunk the grain bag several times in the liquid like a tea bag to extract the maximum flavor. Then discard the bag without squeezing it. Mix the liquid with about 5 gallons (19 L) of brewing liquor. Heat the liquor and stir in the liquid malt extract. Add the corn sugar. Bring the wort to a boil.",[]

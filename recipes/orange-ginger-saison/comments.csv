I just tried it again though with a few tweaks to the original recipe. I substituted the Breiss maltoferm 10001 Malt Extract DME with 2lb extra light DME, only used 1 lb of the Munich Malt 20L, used 6.2 oz flaked barely. one full lb honey, and added 4.6 oz breiss crystal 20 malt. I also swapped the cluster hops with citra hops in equal ammounts, and 1 full ounce each of the sweet orange peel and ginger root, both of which were dried. This batch came out a lot more flavorful than the first which pretty much just smelled and tasted like boozy moonshine style beer. Thanks for the post. I feel like this was a good recipe to cut my teeth on.",[]

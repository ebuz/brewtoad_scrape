""Standard Pale Malt, Crystal, Wheat Malt, Maize, Brewer's Syrup, Brewing sugar, and caramel coloring for any color adjustments."" Website states ""two bittering hops and Fuggle"" Standard english bittering hops were used. Yeast was a guess.  Molasses (in form of treacle and golden syrup) for brewer's syrup. Brown sugar for brewer's sugar. Medium British crystal. Carafa III for color adjustment (because caramel coloring is gross)",['21238']

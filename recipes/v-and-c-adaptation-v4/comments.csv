21253,61745,sdfx,"March 14, 2015 10:48am","This started out as the ""Victory and Chaos"" recipe from John Palmer's ""How to Brew"" that we modified step by step.
In this latest iteration we've incorporated some ideas from ""Brewing Classic Styles"" like adding biscuit malt and adding Challenger hops as a bittering addition.
The weird amounts of hop additions are due to left over hops from previous brews that we kept in the freezer and that we incorporated into this recipe.",[]

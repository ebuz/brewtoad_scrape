<p>First All Grain Batch with my new Mash Tun.  There is a little weeping around the ball valve that I need to fix before the next batch. I plan on using the mash and first runnings for the IRS and then using the second runnings to make a toasted coconut stout.</p>

<p>Made my first yeast starters as well.
I made a mini mash using a couple of pounds of crushed 2 row in a few quarts of 155 degree water for an hour and then sparged by dumping 170 degree water over it. Not pretty, but it worked. I also added a little brown sugar to the "wort" i made. I ended up with about a gallon of sweet wort which I split between two growlers and in one I added a packet of S-04 and in the other I added a Smack Pack of Wyeast Abbey Ale II. They have been in the growlers for over 24 hours and are bubbling nicely and the yeast has been lively and active.</p>

<p>Mash: added 6.5 gallons of 164 degree water to my mash tun.
Stirred in 21 pounds of grain and temp lowered to 150
Closed lid on cooler and set timer for an hour.
In the meantime I started heating 3 gallons of sparge water to 170 degrees</p>

<p>Checked Mash temp after 30 minutes and temp had only dropped down by 1 or 2 degrees.</p>

<p>Since I can't go through a brewday without screwing one thing up, I had the sparge water on the stove on medium heat for an hour, I figured it would get hot enough, but after emptying the mash tun I realized strike water was only 120 degrees. It is on high now and hopefully I'll be able to sparge in the next 10 mins.</p>

<p>Took gravity reading of runoff and it measured 1.085 after adjusting for temp.</p>

<p>I boiled a total 6.4 gallons of wort for an hour and followed the hop schedule in my recipe. .</p>

<p>Unfortunately, again there are always problems, Even though I brought my hose into the garage at the beginning of the brewday it was still frozen solid and my wort chiller would not work. I had no ice or tub big enough to fill with cold water. I poured the wort into a fermenter and sat it outside in the cold and snow. Unfortunately after over an hour outside it was still 100 degrees. I added half a gallon of ice cold water which brought the OG to 1.080 and cooled it to about 85-90 degrees. I went ahead and pitched my yeast starter into the wort and placed the fermenter in my pantry. I'll check on it today to see if it took off.</p>

<p>While my IRS was cooling I added 1 pound of toasted coconut to the mash tun. Then I heated 3 gallons of water to  170 degrees and sparged again and took 4.5 gallons of second runnings. There must have been some left from the previous sparge. I also added 1 lb of brown sugar to the wort.</p>

<p>I heated the second beer to boil and added a quarter ounce of zythos and half an ounce of williamette I had sitting around. I was getting pretty tired by the time it came to a full rolling boil so I only boiled the wort for about 30-40 minutes before I shut it off. I had placed my hose in a tub of boiling water to thaw it so my wort chiller worked like a champ for this beer, chilled it quickly and added 1 gallon of ice cold water to bring the total volume up to about 5 gallons at 1.042.</p>

<p>I pitched the yeast starter of S-04 into the Fast Ferment conical fermenter with the wort.</p>

<td><p>its been roughly 18 hours since I pitched the yeast into both fermenters. The Toasted coconut is bubbling nicely and smells pretty good, but the IRS had little activity but a large amount of foam and looked like it had been active. I checked the gravity on the IRS and it was sitting at 1.052, so still a long way to go, but making good headway, I tasted the sample and it was delicious. Roasty, toasty, light chocolate coffee tasting..  I'll see how it looks this weekend before pitching extra yeast.</p></td>

<td><p>Roughly 40 hours now since I pitched the yeast and the IRS is bubbling regularly. This morning it was going balls out, but it has slowed down significantly now. </p>

<p>I took a sample of the Toasted coconut and gravity is sitting at 1.008.  Flavor was ok, but no body at all. I think i'll wait till the weekend and then rack to secondary with a pound of lactose and a pound of toasted coconut. in a hop bag.</p></td>

<td><p>Took sample and gravity for IRS and it was sitting at 1.017, so its fairly attenuated at this point. Taste was still delightful but not as much body (obviously) so I think I'll add a mix of maltodextrine and lactose to the beer in the secondary along with the chocolate and vanilla. I have been doing some reading and I think the problem I had in the mash was sparging too quickly. I had it open at full blast during sparge and letting the water out, and it needs to be a trickle and take about 20-30 for all the water to run out. I did it too quick and didn't get the gravity points I wanted.  </p></td>

<td><p>Took Gravity reading of Toasted coconut today. Gravity is 1.007, no body, very roasty flavors, more of a brown ale in color, not very stout like. I toasted 3 bags (18 or so ounces) of coconut (1 bag sweetened, 2 bags unsweetened) and added it to the fast ferment in a sanitized muslin bag. Unfortunately I won't be able to check the beer again until next week, so then I will add the vanilla, malto and lactose to this beer. </p>

<p>I did not take another gravity reading of the IRS yet, but I will move it to secondary with cocoa, vanilla, and lactose/malto next week as well. </p></td>

<td><p>Moved IRS to secondary and gravity is 1.014. Mixed a box of 100% cocoa with a little powdered sugar and a cup or two of water in a pot and stirred it into a thick slurry. I added the slurry and a half bag of 60% cocoa ghiradelli chocolate chips to the carboy before racking. Tasted after adding chocolate (which brought gravity to 1.018) and it tasted strongly of bitter chocolate. I plan on adding some lactose and malto in the next day or so and then letting it sit for another few weeks before bottling.</p>

<p>toasted coconut is a conundrum to me. Gravity is 1.006 and it is real thin in the mouthfeel department. It tastes strongly of toasted coconut but also has a slight tang. I dont know if it got infected with the coconut or if the coconut sugars gave it an odd flavor but there is a bit of a sour quality. Very tasoted coconut though. there is also a thin layer of what appears to be oil on the top of the beer that i will try to leave behind when bottling. I'll also be adding some malto to this beer and letting it sit for a few days before bottling, probably this weekend.</p></td>

<td><p>I took 8oz of lactose and 4oz of maltodextrine and brought it to a boil then added 1tbsp of vanilla extract and added it to the carboy. I took a sample at this time and it was thick as hell with suspended cocoa. I filtered the sample through a coffee filter and it tasted of dark fruit and cocoa. I'm hoping some extra time and the lactose and malto will do some magic. Starting to get worried about it. Hoping the flavors all come together.</p>

<p>I added 4oz of malto and a cup of water boiled and a tbsp of vanilla to toasted coconut as well. No lacto, but I'm hoping it raises the body a bit. I'll be bottling or kegging it soon so we'll see then.</p></td>

In order to do this I took 1 pound of dark brown sugar and boiled it for a couple of minutes in a cup or so of water making a very dark thick liquid which I added to the keg before racking the beer over. It is for sure fermenting still, apparently even though s-04 compact well and is a dry yeast enough stays in suspension to kick up fermentation again. Need to figure out a way to cold crash it to stop fermentation before I lose all my gravity points. Before kegging gravity was 1.010. The brown sugar should have brought it to 1.019 but it'll drop to 1.014 if I don't stop it. I would like for it to stay in the 1.017 area. Should be drinking it soon though. Fingers crossed.</p></td>

<td><p>So, the brown sugar in the toasted coconut didnt ferment out at all. Overly sweet. I have the keg in the cooler with a space heater at about 75 degrees and I am hoping to ferment it down. The keg is for sure packed with co2. </p>

<p>I'll be bottling the Belgian stout in the next few days to give it time to bottle condition. We'll see how that turns out then.</p></td>

<td><p>I bottled the Belgian Stout. Added enough corn sugar/simple syrup to the fermenter to get it to 1.9 vols. Though I didn't mix it well at all so I am hoping the bottles actually carbonate, otherwise I'll have to open them up and add sugar directly to the bottles. That'll suck. </p>

<p>The first few bombers had quite a bit of thick looking sludge in them, so I sat them aside for myself and when it cleared out some I set the good ones aside for Colin. I also bottled a few 12 ouncers for competition purposes. </p>

<p>The flavor was great. Coffee is the first flavor before mellowing out to a dark chocolate and then a dark plum/fig/date flavor at the end. I'm hoping that with time in the bottle plus a little carbonation it will be dead on perfect. I'm really excited about it.</p>

<p>Toasted coconut is a bust I think. It sat in the hotbox with my saison at around 80 degrees for a few weeks and now I don't know what to do with it. I think I'm going to buy like 4 large bags of ice and throw them in my cooler with some frozen jugs of water and such to chill it down enough to maybe for carb it a little. Then if it tastes drinkable I guess I'll bottle it or something maybe. I hate giving up on a beer, but this one has been a disaster from the start.</p></td>

<dd><p>its been roughly 18 hours since I pitched the yeast into both fermenters. The Toasted coconut is bubbling nicely and smells pretty good, but the IRS had little activity but a large amount of foam and looked like it had been active. I checked the gravity on the IRS and it was sitting at 1.052, so still a long way to go, but making good headway, I tasted the sample and it was delicious. Roasty, toasty, light chocolate coffee tasting..  I'll see how it looks this weekend before pitching extra yeast.</p></dd>

<dd><p>Roughly 40 hours now since I pitched the yeast and the IRS is bubbling regularly. This morning it was going balls out, but it has slowed down significantly now. </p>

<p>I took a sample of the Toasted coconut and gravity is sitting at 1.008.  Flavor was ok, but no body at all. I think i'll wait till the weekend and then rack to secondary with a pound of lactose and a pound of toasted coconut. in a hop bag.</p></dd>

<dd><p>Took sample and gravity for IRS and it was sitting at 1.017, so its fairly attenuated at this point. Taste was still delightful but not as much body (obviously) so I think I'll add a mix of maltodextrine and lactose to the beer in the secondary along with the chocolate and vanilla. I have been doing some reading and I think the problem I had in the mash was sparging too quickly. I had it open at full blast during sparge and letting the water out, and it needs to be a trickle and take about 20-30 for all the water to run out. I did it too quick and didn't get the gravity points I wanted.  </p></dd>

<dd><p>Took Gravity reading of Toasted coconut today. Gravity is 1.007, no body, very roasty flavors, more of a brown ale in color, not very stout like. I toasted 3 bags (18 or so ounces) of coconut (1 bag sweetened, 2 bags unsweetened) and added it to the fast ferment in a sanitized muslin bag. Unfortunately I won't be able to check the beer again until next week, so then I will add the vanilla, malto and lactose to this beer. </p>

<p>I did not take another gravity reading of the IRS yet, but I will move it to secondary with cocoa, vanilla, and lactose/malto next week as well. </p></dd>

<dd><p>Moved IRS to secondary and gravity is 1.014. Mixed a box of 100% cocoa with a little powdered sugar and a cup or two of water in a pot and stirred it into a thick slurry. I added the slurry and a half bag of 60% cocoa ghiradelli chocolate chips to the carboy before racking. Tasted after adding chocolate (which brought gravity to 1.018) and it tasted strongly of bitter chocolate. I plan on adding some lactose and malto in the next day or so and then letting it sit for another few weeks before bottling.</p>

<p>toasted coconut is a conundrum to me. Gravity is 1.006 and it is real thin in the mouthfeel department. It tastes strongly of toasted coconut but also has a slight tang. I dont know if it got infected with the coconut or if the coconut sugars gave it an odd flavor but there is a bit of a sour quality. Very tasoted coconut though. there is also a thin layer of what appears to be oil on the top of the beer that i will try to leave behind when bottling. I'll also be adding some malto to this beer and letting it sit for a few days before bottling, probably this weekend.</p></dd>

<dd><p>I took 8oz of lactose and 4oz of maltodextrine and brought it to a boil then added 1tbsp of vanilla extract and added it to the carboy. I took a sample at this time and it was thick as hell with suspended cocoa. I filtered the sample through a coffee filter and it tasted of dark fruit and cocoa. I'm hoping some extra time and the lactose and malto will do some magic. Starting to get worried about it. Hoping the flavors all come together.</p>

<p>I added 4oz of malto and a cup of water boiled and a tbsp of vanilla to toasted coconut as well. No lacto, but I'm hoping it raises the body a bit. I'll be bottling or kegging it soon so we'll see then.</p></dd>

24331,61777,Big Fat Baby Brew,"November 02, 2016  6:47pm","A few things about this recipe which don't fit the Duchesse de Bourgogne I have had include:
- 13 SRM is much lighter than what I have had.
- 7.3% ABV is much higher than the 6.0% on the bottle
- Corn?  This is such a big, complex beer with a nice malt base. 
- I can't get close to 18IBU with the suggested hops via Beersmith.
I don't mean to criticize, but I can't help but wonder. I'll try this sometime soon and see for myself. 
I'm going to try building something around Jamil's recipe as a starting point.",[]

19433,43066,GregorK,"September 20, 2014  8:09pm","It's ""Maybe"" because maybe it's and Irish Red and maybe not.  In all honestly, this is an attempt to make a recipe I failed to make a year ago.  Found the ingredients, but not specifics like, ""Crystal Malt"" but not what kind.  I suspect 40L but went with 80L when repurchasing.  Trying to use the year old 1098 English Ale is likely to fail, so I have a backup 1028 London Ale - both Wyeast - as a backup.  I'll leave a followup in 8 weeks to comment on how this really turned out!
Good Brewing!",[]

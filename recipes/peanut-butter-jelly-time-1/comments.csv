I just mixed the peanut butter powder with vodka and find that the powder to liquid ratio makes for a very powdery mix. Did you have this problem? What did you do? Or how did you add the peanut powder to your recipe?",['20792']
20792,30410,scottonthepot,"February 04, 2015 10:27pm",I didn't really measure out the amount of vodka that I used with the pb2.  I just dumped the bag of pb2 into a bowl and then poured vodka into and stirred until it was a little bit more runny than regular peanut butter.,[]

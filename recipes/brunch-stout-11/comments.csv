After 2 weeks, sharp and hot, but pleasant flavors rounded out with chocolate.  After 1 month, incredible.  The chocolate and coffee give it a mocha-like flavor, the body is smooth and rich and slightly oily like coffee from a french press, the coffee, roasted malts, and hops add the perfect balanced bitterness, and the dark fruit flavors add layers of depth.  Never took a FG, but one bottle and ""damn"".  Double trouble b/c it's so delicious and easy drinking as well.  Will definitely be putting this in the rotation, may tweak it going forward.",[]

Ordered a tonne of Copper pipe from B&Q (over 50% off!) and got some hose pipe too + connectors too. 10mm copper pipe can be inserted into the hose pipe and jubilee clips will hold it on to the end... so went for 10mm pipe! you not on FB? I'm stuck with my recipe, Reading How to Brew guides - they suggest boiling 50% of the water and dropping in the FV to cool, then using the other 50% of the water to do the brew - I assume my DME calculations need to be based on the whole volume of water? You on any social media where I can find you? Gonna attempt my first extract this afternoon/evening... eeeeek!",[]

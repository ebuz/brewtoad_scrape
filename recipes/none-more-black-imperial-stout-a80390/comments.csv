A: Pours very dark brown/black, pretty opaque in the glass (but I guess it could be a little bit more black), very thin/minimal head, dark tan. 
S: Chocolate and mild burnt toast smell. 
T: At first taste is chocolate, coffee, dark caramel. Then the bitter roast comes in strong but mellow, a little smokey. Aftertaste is dark, sweet bitter. 
M: Moderately thick, silky smooth. Can feel the alcohol warmth but it is well balanced. 
O: Fantastic!",[]

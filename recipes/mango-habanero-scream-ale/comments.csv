I dropped the hibiscus and coconut and used no habanero while fermenting. I thawed 5 lbs of cut up mango and soaked in just enough rum to cover them. I then smashed them a little to make it easier for the yeast to extract the sugars. After about two weeks in primary, I racked the beer onto the smashed mangoes and let ferment out for 3-4 weeks. It had a decent amount of tropical flavor already from the Citra. I chopped up 2 or 3 habaneros and steeped them in 4-6 oz of vodka to create a tincture. It was very, very hot. At bottling, I bottled one case as is (no habanero) for a mango cream ale. Then I added one shot glass of the tincture and gently stirred and tasted. It didn't seem like enough so I added a little over half a shot glass more. It seemed just about right and bottled the second case. Although the mango cream ale was tasty, I wish I did the whole batch with the habanero. It came out fantastic. Everyone who tried it loved it. At first sip, there wasn't much heat. As the temp rose, a little more heat came out along with the tropical flavor. While you could feel the heat, it didn't linger long. I will be making this again for Summer 2015 but the whole batch will have habanero.",['21677']

The plan is to just leave it there for a few days. If I need to, I should be able to raise the temperature by moving it away from the wall in the dining room.  I'll probaby do that in a couple days just to help it fully attenuate.",[]

Unfortunately, the cold spell ended and it got quite hot:  plus 80 F.  This happened several days and I was hoping the impact would be minimal.  Took a sample and it went down to around 1.016 which is about right but it's got some weird esters/fusels most likely from the high fermentation temps.  I've been letting it sit and hoping it will clean up some.  UPDATE:  Good news.  Just pulled a sample and it tastes much better.  The fusel-y thing seems to be softening more into an estery type thing (strawberry?) but it's way better than it was a week ago.  I'm going to leave this on the yeast for about another week and then keg.  The wait stinks but this should be very ok after another week on the yeast and then two weeks in the keg.",[]

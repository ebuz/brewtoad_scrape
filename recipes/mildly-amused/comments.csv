I'm going to try this one tomorrow with a couple of changes. I have some Briess Mild that I will use in place of the Pearl. I'll use S-04 instead of the 1768, because I have been using it for years for all my English beers, and I love the reliability, strong flocculation, clean flavor and good attenuation. It is so forgiving. Adding some yeast nutrient and epsom salts. Probably some Calcium Chloride too. 
My Brewtarget software has the IBUs way higher at 39. I was planning on doing FWH, so I might back off a bit on the first addition to compensate.

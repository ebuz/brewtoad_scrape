18197,31492,TonyYates,"May 19, 2014  2:38pm","Hi! I didn't make any changes to the core recipe, EXCEPT add the pound of coconut at the end of the boil. Oh, and I'll add one more thing or note, and that is to add one pound of coconut into the keg when kegging, and keep it in there for 5 days. That's it. I did this because my original attempt at this did not include steeping the coconut in the whirlpool at the end of the boil, it only included the 5 days steeping in the keg. It was great and amazing the first week, but in just 3 weeks the coconut has faded so much. So I've aligned the coconut routine in this beer to be just like the Coconut IPA. I'll talk more about it in this weeks HBW video (21 May, 2014). Cheers!",['20724']

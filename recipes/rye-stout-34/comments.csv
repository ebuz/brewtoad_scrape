Thoroughly pleased with this recipe. The flaked rye gives a full mouth feel, yet the beer doesn't come off as heavy or have a lingering mouth feel. The palate gets cleansed nicely with each drink.
The roast is at a good place, very noticeable but not acrid.
I'm not sure there is really anything to change about this recipe, perhaps boost the abv slightly to get up over 5, but I'm not sure it would have the same sessionable stout characteristics.",[]

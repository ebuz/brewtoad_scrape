1st, how did this turn out? sounds like a wonderfully refreshing brew! after years of brewing, i am still trying to nail down the best way to utilize coffee in beer. was it coffee-y enough?
thanks!",['17292']

One of my top 3 brews so far. I would definitely use the lightest roast you can find and use it sparingly as the lighter roasts tend to have more caffeine than the darker roasts. I think using a nice citrusy hop is a must as well, wouldn't be very good with a noble hop. I wanted to use Amarillo but my LHBS only Ahtanum when I did my test 1 gallon batch. It turned out really good, but now that I have some Amarillo I think it could be even better, but I haven't brewed it with Amarillo yet. It you do it with Amarillo, you will have to let me know how it turns out.",['17335']

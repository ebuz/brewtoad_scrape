Slow lag period probably because I didn't use a starter.  By 24 hours it was going pretty good.  It's still chugging along with a full krausen.  I checked gravity today and it's only down to 1.040 but it's chugging along nicely.  Sample tasted good, clean, yeasty.  Just gonna let this go.  Temps are going up the middle of this week and I'll probably just let it free climb up to 68 or so, stopping it there with a water bath or wet towel should it become necessary.",[]
23506,9037,Jmat,"March 14, 2016  9:28pm",3/14/16 - checked gravity today and it as around 1.012-1.013 at  68-70F (hydrometer is calibrated to 68).  Krausen is fully dropped.  This is probably done.  Sample tasted good.  Tasted good.  Still some yeast/greenness in there but really very good.  Not really getting much esters which was the idea.  Hop bitterness fell back quite a bit but then it's not as cold as last time so perception of bitterness might be higher at a lower temp which would be fine.  Color is in the ballpark for dead guy as is the flavor although it certainly lacks that distinctly pacman profile.  Still I'm hoping this will stack up nicely side by side with the real thing.  I think it makes sense to let this sit 6 or more days to clean up a bit more and then keg or bottle.,[]

I hope the bitterness doesn't fade too much as it's at a pretty good level right now.  Used 3/4 cups of corn sugar to bottle.  Plan is to just let it sit for at least two more weeks and then if I'm really disciplined, some cold conditioning.  Half of the bottles went to Kevin.",[]

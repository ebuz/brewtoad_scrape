19266,10084,Dogphish,"August 23, 2014  6:39pm","The first batch was a disaster. My second batch was much too sweet, even at 1.006 FG and 40 IBU. Then a reliable source told me that Bikini Beer is 80 IBU. So, I adjusted the IBUs of the recipe with 60 minute bittering hop additions. I will brew again tomorrow. If all goes well, I will dry hop with 3 or 4 ounces of El Dorado hop pellets, which have a watermelon candy flavor/aroma, if I recall correctly.",['19270']
19270,33884,Dove,"August 24, 2014 10:26am",Ah I've been trying to find out how many IBU the Bikini Beer is supposed to be! Thanks for the info. I've found that caramel 10 can contribute a fair amount of sweetness even in small amounts. Guess we'll have to keep experimenting! Good luck with the brew and let me know how it's tasting.,[]

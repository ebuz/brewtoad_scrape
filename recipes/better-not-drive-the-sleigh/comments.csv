18106,38504,Rysk Brewing Co.,"May 06, 2014  5:27pm","So? SO!   What is the verdict - or are you going to let this one age for a time?   I found that after about 3 months in the bottle, the flavours started to balance out, and now at 6 months, the alcohol is very subdued (and at 11.7% that is a good thing!)",[]
20003,58394,BadDaddy,"November 16, 2014  9:19pm","I brewed this one up in September, gave it 30 days in  primary and secondary (combined), and  bottled in October. Cracked the first bottle today after 4 weeks (3 on the shelf, 1 in the fridge), and I gotta say that it's a really good brew! The cloves and orange come on strong at first, with a slightly sweet finish mixed with the orange and cloves.
 I'm fairly new to all-grain brewing (this is only my 3rd batch of all-grain), but I'm pleased with the flavor and consistency at 9.9%ABV...I tried the  multi-stage mashing at 50-60-70°C, gave it an hour lautering at 68°C then did a continuous sparge for about 30 minutes (without any sparge water...just the wort, nice and slow).
 All in all, it could probably use another month of aging...the flavors are all good, but have a distinct, almost harsh bite. In my impatience to try it today, it definitely needs more time to age and meld the flavors. I'll mark my calendar to crack another bottle on 13 December and report the progress then.
 Thank guys for posting this recipe!",[]

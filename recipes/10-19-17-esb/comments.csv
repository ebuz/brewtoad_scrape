Split into two carboys and pitched one with Nottingham yeast (2pks) )which I made a starter for 4 hours prior to pitching.  Pitched the other with Safale-05 (2pks) dry pitched straight into carboy. Nottingham was bubbling within the hour and blowing foam into the blow off pale this evening 10/20 even with the sufficient head space in the carboy. Safale-05 carboy bubbling this evening but not overly vigorous.  OG was 1.058. Color was darker than intended probably due to use of Swaen Malt which I hadn't used before.  It was a very rich malt, I liked it, but would probably tone the ratios back a bit.",['25432']

20506,43599,Joey Groszek,"January 08, 2015  4:07am","Mash strike temp was 3 gal at 178 F.  ~2 Gal were recovered and sparged through again (5 min.).   ~1 gal at 171 F was sparged 5 min.  0.5 gal at 171 F Sparged x3
This time we forgot to add pH buffer
all the water used in the mash was from Britta pitcher
After collecting 4.5 gal of runnings in the boil kettle the remainder was collected in a secondary kettle to boil and add to the fermentation bucket
Today was the first time we used a wart chiller
Boil was done outside in ~17F ambient temp",[]

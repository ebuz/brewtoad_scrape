Keep in mind I used the 22oz listed above on 2.5 gallons of finished beer (I split this batch), and they only sat for 4 days. Added a lot of character. I feel the nelson really rounds it together with the saison spice...
I peeled and cubed the cucumbers (with a sanitized peeler, board, and knife, of course), rinsed them in starsan, and just threw them in. No freezing or pureeing necessary.",[]

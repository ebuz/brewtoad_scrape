The IBU's show higher than 'ideal' but with a partial boil (if you did say, 3 gallons, 2.5, etc) on the stove you're going to get slightly less useage, so actual IBU's should be just fine. 
Recipe is 5 Gallons. Don't be afraid of leaving lots of headspace in the carboy, this thing will most likely ferment pretty crazy and foam all over. (If you can, attach a blowoff tube, or let it ferment in the bathtub, etc. It can be a big mess otherwise)",[]

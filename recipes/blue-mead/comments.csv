Filled brewpot (x quarts...?) to top with LA City tap water (North Hollywood) leaving 4 inches or so for boil over and added honey. Brought to boil. Removed from burner and turned off burner. Measured honey to 6 lbs (plus tiny extra for what sticks). Poured in to pot and stirred vigorously so no honey burns on bottom. Fully saturated mixture and then placed back on burner to bring to rolling boil again. At rolling boil, added 1 oz of Hallertau pellet hops and closed lid. At 10 minutes remaining (of the 60 min. boil) added coriander (crushed in a ziplock first) and orange peel. at 0 minutes removed from boil, and let cool.",[]

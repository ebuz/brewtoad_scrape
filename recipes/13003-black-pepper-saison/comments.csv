I don't do this anymore as it added a spicyness in the back of the throat that I don' t like. The black pepper flavor is in the black husk and the spicy stuff is in the white core. https://www.brewtoad.com/recipes/16005-pepper-rebellion-5e4d06 this is the current version that I make, with a different name.",[]

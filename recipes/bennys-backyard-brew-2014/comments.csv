This is there were a full 5 oz of Willamettes and 1 oz of home grown chinooks.  These were dried for a few days prior so they lost a lot of water weight, they would have been in the 5 oz realm, same as the Willamette hops.
I used 2 different yeasts as 1 my supplier was out of the British White Labs, and I had the Trappist and English on hand and thought I'd mix it up.",[]

After letting it age in the kegerator for 3 more weeks, its flavor was greatly improved, but I still found it necessary to blend it my KÃ¶lsch (20% per glass) to be drinkable.  It also has been noted to have too low of a hop profile.  I will reduce ginger and add hops.  This beer actually tastes really good with food, but I'd like it to taste better by itself as well.",[]

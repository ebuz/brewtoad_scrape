Given the winter season, I'm in to porters and stouts at present and I've always been a fan of Deschutes as a brewery and the Black Butte as a brew.  Therefore, I figured this would be as good of a place as any to get back into homebrewing after a multi-year layoff.  I just bottled this brew and, naturally, sampled a taste.  I think the recipe is likely pretty darn close for the typical extract brewer.  However, being a hophead, one of the things I migrated to before the aforementioned layoff is a full volume boil.  While this batch will not go to waste, I will definitely go to a tamer hop than the galena (or use half as much next time) as mine came out much more bitter than 25 IBU.  That is a statement about my rustiness way more than your recipe though.  I also substituted a 1/4 ounce of roasted barley for the same amount of the chocolate malt just because I like a touch more ""coffee"" to the style.  I think THAT part worked.  All in all a good shake down cruise for my brewing to shake some rust off.  I plan on running a few extract batches just to get comfortable before making that ultimate jump to mashing.
Cheers!",[]

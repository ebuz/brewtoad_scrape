Not nearly enough bitterness. Should have hopped earlier in the boil with some Citra or other high AA hops. A hop shot or even bigger dry hop would have helped with aroma. Hops were the most off part of this beer overall. Flaked wheat could have added some cloudiness which would have been welcomed as well. 
Fermented a little too high abv, but I messed up and did not record the final numbers anywhere that I can find.",[]

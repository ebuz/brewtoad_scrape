Many recipes call for the corn to be popped, but I don't have the capacity, so I getting the popcorn and then follow this advice from an online article: ""To perform a cereal mash using cornmeal or grits, combine 10% 6-row barley malt or 15% 2-row barley malt by dry weight with the corn. Place the cornmeal or grits in a heavy saucepan and add water until the mixture is like a soupy batter and begin heating it. Carefully heat this cereal mash to 158 °F (70 °C) and hold it at that temperature for at least five minutes. This will allow the amylase enzymes supplied by the malt to convert stray starch molecules and begin to loosen the remaining starch “granules” in the corn. The heavy lifting of starch conversion will take place in the main mash. After the short conversion rest at 158 °F (70 °C), add heat to bring the cereal mash to a boil and boil it gently for 30 minutes. You will need to stir the mash constantly and may need to add water to keep the mixture fluid and moving to prevent it from scorching on the bottom of the pan. At the end of the cereal mash cooking process, the starch will have gelatinized and be in a form that the amylase in the main mash will be able to convert to sugar.""
So far no complaints.",['25986']

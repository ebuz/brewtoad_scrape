Also, would you be interested in setting aside 1 gallon to do any experimental stuff?  Thinking (off the top of my head) something along the lines of cold brewed coffee, oak chips (perhaps soaked with rye whiskey, hazelnut liquor, or some other liquor), honey and berries (rasp, blue or medley), cranberry, smoked bacon (could almost turn in to a DoppelPorterRoggenRauchBier), honey and bananas, strawberry banana vanilla bean,  mustard seed.  Just some thoughts!",[]

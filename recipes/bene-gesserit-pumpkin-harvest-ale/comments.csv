I am so sorry for the extreme delay on this. I haven't been brewing so I haven't got the alerts until now.
About a month in, the spices are still way too harsh, and it does need more time to mellow out. It gets a lot more pumpkin flavor and the spices take more of a back seat during this time. The last time on my brew log, I ended up adding too much cloves, so that spice definitely comes through this time around.
Right now I age it for about 7-8 months, and in the same conditions I ferment (at the time, it was under the stairwell in a house that's kept at ~76ÂºF)",[]

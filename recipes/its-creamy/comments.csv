Adding malt extract later in the boil isn't really going to do anything. I suggest adding it all at the beginning and you will get more ""kettle caramelization""..in other words the heat will caramelize some of the sugar from the malt and give you a better taste. 2. For the hops...depending on what you're going for, Amarillo is the most citrusy and adding it later in the boil will give you more of the citrus flavor and aroma than adding it first. Crystal is a very smooth and mellow hop and Cascade is a little citrusy and a little piney. If you want to accentuate the citrus I would switch the amarillo and cascade time and amounts. If that's not what you're going for then go for it and see how it turns out!
Looks good man.",[]

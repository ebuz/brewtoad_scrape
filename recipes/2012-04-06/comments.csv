18258,20812,jesran,"May 25, 2014  5:01pm",Too much aromaticâ€¦ maybe too much special B and carapils too. Just too much specialty malts. Cloying sweet taste. Almondy smell was nice but too much sweet in mouth. Nothing to balance it out in yeast profile. All esters like pear. No clove or spiciness. Repurposed almost the whole keg into the solera barrel. The unfermented specialty grains should give the brett something to chew on for awhile.,[]

17325,9037,Jmat,"February 13, 2014  8:30pm","Brewed on 2/13/14.  BIAB technique on the grain.  Mashed in around 150-152.  Forgot to set the timer initially so I guestimated I lost 15 minutes before I started the timer.  If the hops are off, that is why.  Pitched at around 62 F.",[]

I mashed all the grain together (Golden Promise and Crystal), so 5 lbs 4 oz.  I yielded 3 1/2 gallons of 1.045 wort.  Need to figure out how to do that math or find a calculator.",[]
17348,9037,Jmat,"February 16, 2014  4:01am",I calculated the efficiency and it came out to 81.5% which seems in line with the slightly higher gravity than predicted in the final brew.,[]

Dry hopped with 1 oz. Styrian Goldings in a hop bag tied up with some dental floss.  I'll check the aroma on Saturday and go from there.",[]

Next time I might try a little crystal 60 (t weigh the bag down and it mostly floated towards the top.  There was a sulfer-y thing going on right after I put it on the gas but that quickly dissipated with some cold conditioning.",[]

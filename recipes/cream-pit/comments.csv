Testing during fermentation and different stages of carbonization made me nervous because the allspice was pretty ""in your face."" However, after a solid 2+ weeks in the bottle (fully carbonated) the result was complexly layered but incredibly smooth. First you're hit with fresh peach (even a little tart), then it rounds out to a warm only slightly fruity flavor, dissipating into a warm/fresh aftertaste from the rosemary. I'm not going to change anything about this - making another batch ASAP.",[]

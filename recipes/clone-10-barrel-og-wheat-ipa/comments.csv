17691,32661,asteveoconnor,"March 19, 2014 11:55pm","We opened two 12 oz. bottles; hoppy, with a big malty profile with wheat sweet tones; faint hop aroma, big head: maybe too big, some ""spouting;"" noticeable warming effect, great finish, I want more: this is a good beer!",[]
17692,32661,asteveoconnor,"March 20, 2014 12:30am","This beer needs more more hop aroma and flavor; so, the next batch of ""hoppy"" beer will be dry-hopped much more; and, especially during secondary fermentation.
This beer displays a malty-sweet aroma with some of those ""sharp"" Galaxy hop notes in the background",[]

A slight hint of banana/clove, great head retention, beautiful unfiltered cloudy golden color.  It came out higher ABV than I initially planned - next go-round might try it with just a 60-minute mash instead of 90.  Overall, very happy with it, and think it will only be better with a bit more time to carbonate.  I was going for the Leffe Blond genre, and I think I nailed it (with the exception of the higher ABV).",[]

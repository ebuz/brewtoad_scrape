Got sidetracked after starting primary fermentation.  Didn't move from conical ferment or to glass car boy until 6/12 (18 days after boil).  Am planning to dry hop in secondary",[]

Got sidetracked after starting fermentation on 5/25.  Was left in conical for primary until 6/12 (18 days), then moved to glass carboy for secondary.  Will dry hop in secondary for one week, then keg this batch.",[]

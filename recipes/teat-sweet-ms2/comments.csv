Entry ID: 7026
Style: 13B Sweet Stout
Beer Info: 
Descriptors: 
Bottle Inspection: All Good
Bottle Comments: 
Aroma:
A bit yeasty in the nose with a touch of spicy phenolic. Dark dried fruit esters with dark roast coffee come next, followed by sweet alcohol. No hops or diacetyl. Light caramel in the background.
6 / 12
Appearance:
Black with some ruby highlights. Opaque. Thick, tan head that persists for a long time with tight bubbles.
3 / 3
Flavor:
Roasted malt flavors and caramel dominate the palate up front. These give way to some spicy alcohol and intense sweetness. Finish is very sweet with a touch of roast that helps provide a little bit of balance, but still a bit cloying. No hop flavor. Very light bitterness. No DMS or diacetyl.
10 / 20
Mouthfeel:
Medium body with moderately high carbonation. No alcohol warming or astrigency. A touch of creaminess. Alcohol lends a bit of slickness, and the residual sugars leave the mouth feeling a bit sticky.
3 / 5
Overall:
A good attempt at the style that lacks balance and complexity. The balance is much too far to the sweet side. This is evident both in the aroma and flavor. The beer needs more roast malt to add complexity and to help balance the sweetness. Needs more of the coffee/chocolate flavors/aromas and less caramel and lactose if used. Best examples are reminiscent of a sweetened latte. Alchohol flavor and aroma also seem a bit high for style, although I don't get any alcohol warming. Overall, seems like a fairly clean fermentation, although the esters are a bit on the high side. Perhaps choose a more neutral yeast.

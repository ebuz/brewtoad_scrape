Then it dropped suddenly to 148 after 20 minutes.  Raised it again.  Finally, the iodine test was never great.  I gave up at 90 minutes.  At knock out, the bottom got too hot and burned some of the grain.  I'm hoping it stayed stuck to the bottom and didn't effect the flavor.  Followed the rest of the steps and that worked better.  I may be a little below 5 gallons on the final, but didn't add water as the Gravity was only 1.048 instead of 1.053.  sigh.  added two packs of dry nottingham yeast after rehydrating it.",[]

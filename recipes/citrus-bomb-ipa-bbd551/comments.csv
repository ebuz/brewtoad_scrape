24181,54798,Tad,"September 20, 2016  9:43pm",I dry-hopped the combined 4 ounces in the keg. Flavor was overpowering so I'll pulled it after less than 2 days in the keg. The result: drinkable IPA but kinda meh. I would brew this again -- perhaps chaning up the dry hop -- but do 2 to 3 ounces in secondary and then keg.,[]

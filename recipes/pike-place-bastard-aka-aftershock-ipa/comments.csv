I'm fermenting with the White Labs Equivalent of 1272 right now. I'm curious if you get a lot of sulphur smell in your blow-off?
I pulled the seal off the lid of my fermentor, so it's a covered-open fermentation (no back pressure, but no way shit can float in), since Anchor uses that (at least for Steam, I can't remember if the Liberty Ale fermentors were open or not), and the smell has mostly gone away, but still curious if the Wyeast version does that.",[]

Anyway, no sulfer smell from my fermenter/blowoff. But perhaps I can’t smell anything due to all that Chinook destroying my olfactory senses.",[]

18382,54972,Tacayo Brewing,"June 05, 2014 12:24am","Grind your coffee beans sometime during your boil. The later in the boil the better. Place the grinds into a muslin bag. When your boil is complete and the wort drops under 210F, hang the muslin bag of grind into the hot wort. I usually go for around 5-10 minutes. Remove muslin bag and start your chill. You definitely do NOT want to put the coffee in during the boil as it will put in all the acids.",[]

I'm looking to brew a scottish export and like your ingredients, but I'm not sure if these are the right amounts. Can you confirm? Thanks!",[]

I found the original recipe from this site. i had intially inputted it into BrewToad and tried to match what the original amounts said. I adjusted some small things but i left it mostly like what the site said.",[]

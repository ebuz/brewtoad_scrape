Well it's still fermenting so I will let you know.  I use Gambrinus malt every chance I can because it's a great deal here in the NW.  I've brewed a ton this last month for a wedding.",[]
20224,46350,SEATTLEBREWING,"December 09, 2014  1:45am","Merlin,  I can't say much about the ESB malt but this batch was very ""estery"" but don't think it had anything to do with the malt.  I do think a Continental malt (like Simpson) would be much better if one is willing to spend the extra money. I need to do a lot more research on proper ESB styles to redesign this.",[]

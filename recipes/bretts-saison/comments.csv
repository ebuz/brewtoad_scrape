20018,31131,Martin,"November 18, 2014  5:05am",Racked into a barrel (previously a bourbon barrel but had been used a few times and cleaned out with soda ash) and added the brett (actually white labs Brett Brux but couldn't find that in the ingredient list).  Racking gravity was extremely high (my fermentation area is a little cool staying around 61F) but considering I plan to barrel age for months that is likely not an issue.,[]

Ferment at 62 °F (17 °C), about 7 days. Rack to secondary and condition for 14 days at 62 °F (17 °C). This beer should be bottle conditioned at about 2–2.5 volumes of CO2. As it ages it will take on a brandy-like character and dry out considerably.""  http://byo.com/stories/item/1618-gale-s-prize-old-ale-clone",[]

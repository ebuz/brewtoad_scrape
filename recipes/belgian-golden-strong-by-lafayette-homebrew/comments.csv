Remove your kettle from the heat and add your extract stirring as you go.  Return to heat and boil for 60 minutes adding hops at specified times.  Add dextrose and candi sugar for the last 5 minutes of the boil.  Coll wort and add water to make 5 gallons (if needed) and pitch yeast at about 65°F. If you can, try to gradually increase the fermentation temperature a degree or two a day until you reach 80-85°F after about 2 weeks.  This will give you the best ester profile with amazing pear flavors that this yeast strain is famous for.  If that is not possible, no worries, but ferment it as warm as you can (try for high 70's or 80). Enjoy after a couple of months in the bottle. Like any strong Belgian, this beer will definitely improve as it ages, so try to save a few for 8 to 12 months down the road, you will thank yourself.  Target OG: 1.072. IBUs: 29. SRM: 4.2. ABV: 8.3%.",[]

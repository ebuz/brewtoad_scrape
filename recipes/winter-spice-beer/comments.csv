I used 2 pounds of cherry and have pound of cranberry extract.  I don't think that was an option at the time on this site.  Used zest of one orange, juice of one orange.  Kegged the beer a few days ago and it is tasting fantastic.  I would say the Cinnamon comes through the  most out of the spices.  How did yours end up?",[]

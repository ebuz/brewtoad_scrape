21311,43227,Wilby,"March 17, 2015  5:55pm",This beer is very good. It turned out a little more malty than I wanted so I now know I have to treat all my water to get a starting pH of 5.5 for all water. I have another slightly different recipe I just bottled using this technique so I should be able to verify that assumption.,[]

Forgot lid to mash tun, so used metal lid instead, which hopefully retained the heat. Used 3 gallons for the mash which was probably too little, as there was still room left. Filled up boil kettle to about 6.5 gallons, and at end of boil it looked to be about 6 gallons. Put in kegerator with temperature control set to 19 C, which seems to be holding the fermentation at about 70 F.",[]

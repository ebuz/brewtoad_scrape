Dry hops were actually split, one each in 3 25l batches.  Name of the game here is attenuation.  Mash low and long.  I recommend not raising the temp during mash out, use only moderately warm, or even room temp water to sparge, and that way you get the non-denatured enzymes into solution were they can work even faster on those starches.  Dextrose to dry it out further.  They say the real Duvel is 1.006 from 1.072, which is achieved by having a crazy fermentation regimen (see http://beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000109.html), which I don't believe is realistic for a homebrewer.  Just do your best to get it to 1.010.",[]

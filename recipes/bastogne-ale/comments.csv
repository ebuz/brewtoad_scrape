17755,9037,Jmat,"March 26, 2014  6:21am","This was supposed to be an Orval clone and after doing some research on Brett, I realized my OG should be 1.055.  I boiled, cooled and added a gallon of water.  I'm now concerned about infection and oxygenation.  Fermentation is still very active however, so I'm hoping this will scrub any excess O2.  We'll see.",[]
17938,9037,Jmat,"April 15, 2014  6:12pm",This ended up fermenting down to 1.008.  Tasted pretty good.  I cold crashed it and then tx'd to a glass carboy to secondary about a week and a half ago (it's 4/15/14).  At that time I added the dregs of 2 bottles of Orval.  Checked it two days ago.  There is some brett funk but I think it's mostly just off the bottles and not from any real brett fermentation.  Gonna let this sit for awhile and then dry hop.  I'll make the call on how much to use for dry hop then.  Right now I'm thinking 1 1/2 to 2 ounces.  Debating whole or pellets (carboy makes whole hops tough).  Maybe I'll transfer to a keg and dry hop in there.  Not sure if I wanna expose a keg to the brett.,[]

Probably start with 1 ounce of styrian golding and go from there.  I was reading online that Orval now uses strisselspalt, but I have Styrian Goldings so that's what I'm going to go with at least for the first dry hop.",[]

18796,9037,Jmat,"July 13, 2014  3:06am","I transferred this to a keg on Thursday, 7/10/14.  I borrowed Scott's ""sour"" autosyphon to keep the brett out of mine.  I cleaned it quite well and thoroughly sanitized it, but if something goes weird, that is the likely source.  I'm not too concerned as I'll throw this in the kegerator as soon as the dry hop is over.  That, along with the high alcohol, ought to keep any nasties in check.  I ended up finding some strisselspalt at keystone, so I dry hopped with 2 oz. of that.  I plan to pull them on Tues or Weds, so that'll b 5-6 days.  Dry hopped with a small paint strainer bag weighed down with some glass marble things from the dollar store (boiled everything to sanitize, of course).",[]
19301,9037,Jmat,"August 29, 2014  4:23am","I was letting this cold condition and I was tweaking the carb level.  It's about right now, but I probably need a longer line to reduce foaming at this carb level.  I can live with it.  Tastes really good.  Not really Orval, but it has a nice brett funkiness to it and it's a solid belgian pale ale with an appropriate bitterness level.  I like it alot.  Don't know if anyone else will.",[]
19768,9037,Jmat,"October 25, 2014  6:07am","This is kicked.  It was pretty good but 5 gallons of Belgian pale ale with brett is probably more than i need to have around.  I might actually do another round of dry hops if I did it again.  Also, if I were shooting for something more Orval-ish, I think I'd use pilsner instead of the two row and skip the caramunich and maybe do a half pound of crystal 80 instead.  It was good as is though.",[]
19769,9037,Jmat,"October 25, 2014  6:09am","Also, maybe ferment higher.  Needed more esters",[]

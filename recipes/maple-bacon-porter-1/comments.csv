Curious how this recipe turned out?  Did the bacon cause any issues?",[]

The bacon addition is based on some research and reading a number of articles about bacon in beer and that seemed to be the best way to do it.  The fat content of the bacon might kill head retention, but that seemed to be the only drawback my research could point to.",[]

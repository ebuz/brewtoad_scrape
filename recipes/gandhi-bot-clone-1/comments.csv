It's a great beer in its own right but I actually was able to get som GB to compare side by side.  Here's my tweaks for next brew:
1). It's missing cascade.  I've learned that they use 3 hops and this was the 3rd in the original.  So I'm going to add that and change the hop schedule a bit. I also want the IBU target closer to 85 (real GB numbers) so will tweak for that. 
2). It's a little darker than the real one.  Need to tweak color, maybe lighter crystal or different malt.  
3). I may change the yeast.  1056 is in the ballpark but I think they are using something a little different.   
I'll post the updated recipe when I brew.   If you make it send a link to yours. 
Cheers
Rob",[]

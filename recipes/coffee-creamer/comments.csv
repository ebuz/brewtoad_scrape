Only thing I could think to add would be some oats for that extra creamy mouthfeel. If you don't feel like using a Kolsch yeast you could use Wyeast 1056 American Ale. Can't wait to try it!,['20171']

I'm going to be experimenting with coffees to get something that's just right for the flavor. Thanks for the tip on the oats and yeast!",[]

20179,44120,John Porterfield,"December 02, 2014  7:52pm","Great! I think that the key is going to be the way the coffee flavor is achieved. I purposely left it vague. This is in competition with a couple of other recipes Jon and I are thinking about (definitely one of them will be a sour), so we may not brew them all. I really like the idea of a coffee cream ale though, so I may do this one on my own if it doesn't make the cut.",[]

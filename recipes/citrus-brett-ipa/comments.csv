19985,56978,BrewHex,"November 15, 2014  4:27pm","The brett was remarkably fast and close to fully attenuated after about 10 days.  Total primary time was 30 days.  Secondary in the keg for one week.  Dry-hopped directly in the keg for another week then carbed.
Tasting after 4 days of carb, it's all Citra and Moetuka.  None of the horse/funk factors of the brett are really apparent which is likely to be expected given the shorter fermentation time (needs much more time for those characteristics to show up).  Remarkably similar to servomyces in terms of the results.  This was mostly an experiment to learn exactly that but it's a very tasty/citrusy IPA as an end result!",[]

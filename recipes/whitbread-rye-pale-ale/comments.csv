Also, you need to join the group that I started (we will be the founding members).  But I thought that we'd expand it to folks that we know that brew so that we can share recipes.  The group is R U Deuceing Me?",['16550']

I will try to join your group now.",[]

I also plan to start using pantyhose at the end of the the tube as I transfer into the fermenter.  I think that the combo will help lead to a more clear final product.",[]

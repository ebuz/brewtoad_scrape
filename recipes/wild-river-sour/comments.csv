18947,46949,Zak,"July 28, 2014  6:47pm","I'm planning on brewing Wednesday morning. I think we should have a target pH to try and sour to, then cut it off and do the boil. Also, I know you have that Richmond Brett strain, but what else/how many others are you wanting to try? I have access to anything White Labs (so, Brett brux, Brett brux Trois, Brett lambicus, and Brett claussenii). I also have the Allagash Brett that I haven't used yet. Keep in mind that White labs has really low pitching rates and Brett starters normally take more time (8 days or so).",[]

18954,35542,gabeslagle,"July 29, 2014  4:59pm","I think taking out the Magnum addition, and adding .5 Centennial at 30 min, and another .5 as a late addition might work well. Going to be a little biscuity with the Victory Malt? I've never used much more than half a pound, and it's always with alot of other malt so I'm not certain. I believe my strain at home is Brett Lambicus (maybe Brux though I guess they're the same?) and the RVA Brett",[]

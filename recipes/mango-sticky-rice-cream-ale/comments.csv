For the coconut, you toast it yourself and then add it when the flocculation has calmed down, is that right? Do you have to boil the fruit or the coconut to reduce the risk of infection? Is the boil time 60 or 90 minutes?
Now that I've got all the questions out of the way, I found this recipe from either Reddit or a home-brew forum, I can't remember which. I spent some time in Southeast Asia and my wife is from Laos so this recipe and many of your other ones really ""speak to me"". I'm excited to try this one out.",[]
25775,33921,anglina,"February 22, 2018  7:36pm",Oh yeah and 2 more questions! How did it turn out? Is there anything you would change about this recipe? I want to maximize the mango sticky rice likeness. Trying to find a beer my wife will like.,[]
25779,102122,deadwolfbones,"February 23, 2018  6:05am","Hey there! I haven't actually made this beer yet. Most of my recipes (if they don't have brew logs) are just ideas in planning stages. This one is heavily based on the Cream of Three Crops recipe from HBT, here: https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/threads/cream-of-three-crops-cream-ale.66503/
To answer your other questions:
1. To get a 5 gal batch, I'd just go to the HBT link above, enter BierMuncher's 11.5-gal recipe as written into your own Brewtoad recipe, and then use Brewtoad's scaling function to reduce it to 5 gal. Then just add 6lb mango, 2lb coconut, and 1lb of lactose.
2. For the coconut, I'd suggest getting unsweetened flakes and toasting them yourself. They're pretty affordable from the bulk bin at your local organic-type grocer. Toast to golden brown and watch them like a hawk because they'll go from golden to black in a heartbeat.
3. I would add it once the SG is steady, i.e. when primary ferm is done. You may get a bit of secondary fermentation from the residual sugar in the coconut and mango, but that's ok.
4. Since the coconut is toasted and the mango is frozen, that should be enough to kill any nasty bugs. I wouldn't worry about boiling it. If you use fresh mango/puree, just freeze it for a day or two and then defrost before adding to the fermenter.
5. The boil time in the original recipe is 90 minutes, so I was planning to stick to that.
Though I haven't made this particular recipe yet, I did make a gose with a ton of mango that came out quite well, so I don't see any reason why this kind of fruiting shouldn't work for this recipe. I also recently brewed a coconut brown ale with a craft brewery in Danang, using 2kg of self-toasted flakes for 100L of beer, and it came out great. Not so sure about the lactose addition, but all it should do is add to the mouthfeel and raise the sweetness a bit. Mango sticky rice is plenty sweet, so it makes sense to me.
Let me know if you brew it and how it goes!",[]

That post is how I found your recipe link. I think a few folks recalculated it for 5 to 5.5 gal batches. Have you thought of brewing with regular rice or even with sticky rice? I have plenty of sticky rice and I understand you have to cook the rice prior to mashing.  I wonder if it will help it match the real dishes flavor.
Did you use decide on Magnum and Opal hops due to inventory or for specific flavors/aroma? Galaxy/Mosaic as the dry hop could be interesting.",[]
25783,102122,deadwolfbones,"February 23, 2018  9:19pm","Yeah, the hop choices were all down to inventory. I just got back from Vietnam and bought a bunch of 1lb bags from Hops Direct (Magnum, Opal, Calypso, Belma, El Dorado, Idaho 7, Huell Melon). I might switch to Huell, not 100% sure yet. I think you should use whatever you like, honestly.
I was planning to use quick rice for convenience's sake, but using sticky rice could definitely be interesting.
Btw, a friend of mine brewed the fish sauce/green mango gose recipe I made here and said the uncarbonated beer was the best thing he's ever produced. I love going big/weird with these recipes. :D",[]

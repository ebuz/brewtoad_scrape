23095,43953,vmwheeler,"December 20, 2015  9:14pm","I just tossed the scoby in primary once the wort cooled.  It took a couple days then it fermented like crazy.  Finished in a few days at a FG lower than expected, something like 1.008.  The scoby I used I got from a friend who brews lots of kombucha and he uses a gallon pickle jar and it was pretty mature so it must have been 3/4"" thick and about 10 inches in diameter or so.  If beer behaves like tea, the longer the scoby stays in the more acetic acid get produce so the more sour it gets.  I took it out after a week.  Sadly, I moved abroad before I ever bottled it and I left it in the care of my brother.  Last I heard he still hasn't bottled it.  This much I can say from a few tastes along the way:  (i) the beer acquired that distinctive kombucha smell which I think will be really great.  (ii) even though it had the smell, the sourness was not very apparent after a week, but I took it out anyway thinking the sourness was masked by various tastes of the immature beer (chunks of hops, yeast, unfermented sugars).   Anyway, I wish I could be a bit more specific for you but the whole thing was pretty experimental.  When my brother finally gets around to bottling the stuff we will know more.  Let me know if you try it yourself.  I would be curious to see how it turns out.",['23125']
23125,71253,Rafa D,"December 27, 2015 11:16am","Thank you for answering. I brew about 3.5 gallons of a saison and used 2 pasteurized gallons of strong kombucha.  The smell and the flavors where there when I started the fermentation with Belle Saison.
You know that by including the scoby directly into contact with the beer, you inoculated the beer with the kombucha cultures?  If you leave the beer enough time, you might create a scoby in the fermentation container.  The problem of having a scoby in the beer is that it will consume the alcohol to create acetic acid.  The only way to stop it is by bottling or pasteurizing the beer.  If you bottle, you will eliminate the oxygen and the bacteria will stop their process.
Please, let me know what your brother do and what are the taste notes he gets.  I'm very interested to know the outcome. I'll do the same. Thanks!",[]

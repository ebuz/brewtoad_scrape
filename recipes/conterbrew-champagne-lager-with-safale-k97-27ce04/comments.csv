If I can get these results with any full bodied german beer style with out the need for real lagering... im all in.  I just kept fermentation temperatures at 65 for 5 days then let it slowly rise to room temperature.   It sat for 6 weeks.  IT is completely clean and delicious.,[]

That will give me 25 gallons of light lagers headed into spring and summer.  Ill just ferment it in my basement.  The whole key to this is keeping it simple.   I have been cleaning and re using the 2112 yeast for almost a year with no noticeable deterioration or mutation of the yeast.    I think a key with this yeast because it is a low attenuater is to make fairly low OG batches and add the corn sugar at high krausen.   That turbo charges the yeast and gets you to a low final gravity.  My last batch ended at 1.007",[]

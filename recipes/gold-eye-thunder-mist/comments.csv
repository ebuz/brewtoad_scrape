26336,14854,Doc Days,"October 17, 2018  2:03am","Here is a great time saver beer. Back notes: Bought some yeast at the local store: 3 liquid for $3 . I kept telling the guy: ""The post says 3 of $10"". I get the yeast home and read the ""use by label"" - ""July 2016"" .  I was mad at the guy faded away pretty quickly. He was trying to just save me money and talk me out of the purchase. 
I decided to see if the yeast was still alive and ran a short 1 gallon batch with a can of extra light LME. After 2 days - zero yeast activity - I added the 2nd pouch of yeast. At day 2 plus 1 hour the original yeast took off. WOW. After a week, I split the 1 gallon into 2 bottles of 1/2 gallons secondary. 
Beer turned out getting me a years worth of Yeast to make more beer with and some great tasting beer at over 11% alcohol. Hope that helps. Doc .",[]

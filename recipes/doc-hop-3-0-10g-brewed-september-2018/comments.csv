BJCP APA) 
Very Balanced with Medium-Low Bitterness and Medium Hoppyness. The Malt profile is very clean and not really to exciting but lets the hop flavor shine through.
DDH APA)
Same as the BJCP Version except the Dry-Hopping added a crazy amount of flavor! Right around a week of carbonating the hops flavor smoothed out and you are left with a really good High-Hop APA. So Easy to drink with huge flavors on a clean simple grain bill.
Entering into Multiple BJCP Events and will also give another update as it ages a little more.",[]

This was an expensive batch, but tasty. Even using a blowoff tube during fermentation, I got spray everywhere in my closet.
My issues:
My lactose didn't mix thoroughly.
First taste was a bit bitter, but great after that. I even added a few vanilla beans at 2nd fermentation.
Overall pretty happy, but probably wouldn't use this recipe again.",[]

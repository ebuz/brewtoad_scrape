Forgot to measure the water for mash, but estimated at 7-8 gallons for 20 lbs of grain
140 for 20 mins
150-160 for 40 mins
boil went great
chilled to 75 then pitched yeast, no starter
next morning it was 64 degrees and no fermentation yet, put in front of heater and when i got back from church 3 hours later it was over 80 on the surface of the glass. 3 hours later and it was down to 76-78
stayed there for the day and night, down to 74 the next morning.",[]

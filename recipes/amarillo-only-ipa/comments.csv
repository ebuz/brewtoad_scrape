21369,1524,Matthew LaFleur,"March 22, 2015  8:20pm","I had the efficiency set to 55%, and I thought the OG was going to more like 6.3% ABV. The OG was actually 1.088. This time around, the efficiency was better. Better maintaining of mash temp (held 152 pretty well), didn't sparge. Just increased the temp of the pot to 170, for 10 mins. Efficiency was probably around 75%. Addition of 3.3 lbs of LME beefed it up to over 8% ABV. Oops.",[]

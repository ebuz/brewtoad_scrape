6 large blood oranges (8 if they are on the small side)
1. Boil 1/2 gallon of water and cool to 170.
2. While water is cooling, zest 6 blood oranges (or 8 if you are using the smaller ones)
3. Once they have been zested, cut the oranges in half and place into a muslin bag.
4. Place blood orange zest and halves in the 170deg water. Steep for entire duration or boil (basically just leave it and forget about it!)",[]

Next Time -- swapping out waimea for another NZ varietal -- push it a different direction.",[]

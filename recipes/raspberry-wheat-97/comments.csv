When you say for the White Wheat that it use is in boil, are you saying that it needs to be put into a bag and put into the boil stage? I am confused as to why you wouldn't use it in the Mash.
Thank you",['24766']

I don't do it during the mash, because any of the aromatics would get boiled off during the boil.  Feel free to hit me up with any additional questions you have regarding going all grain.  I made the jump after about 6 extract batches.",[]

24857,69024,Friar Tuck,"April 03, 2017  1:16pm",I Got an OG of 1.050 turned out this got a bit stronger then expected or calculated. This may not qualify as a Session. I cold crashed and added gelatin to the cold crash for 24hrs then bottled. I used one cup of wildflower honey for priming. I bottled 14 liters and they were carbonated within 4 days. Honey is the BOMB DIGIDITY for PRIMING. This beer turned out pretty good great color aroma and flavor. The IBU level was o point not to bitter yet just enough bitter for those who don't like a high bitter IPA.,[]

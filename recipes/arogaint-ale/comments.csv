  I may just use 05 yeast on this but the m79 seams to fit the style better.","['19189', '19233']"

It was on new equipment (witch I have in the gallery along with some other stuff) my mash ph was low and I'm not to the bottom of that yet and it was hot out. I'm just glad I got it brewed up and hit all my numbers right on.,[]
